            Just been totting up some figures on how <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> is doing, thought I'd share them with anyone that's interested.

<blockquote>These are very rough figures, generated with no scientific consistency, some are cumulative and others are based just on the last full month. They're more just to satisfy my curiosity than to be rigorously accurate.</blockquote>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Downloads</td>
    <td>1,800 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unique visitors</td>
    <td>5,500 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Page views</td>
    <td>13,000 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mailing list messages</td>
    <td>450 per month</td>
  <tr>
    <td>Commits</td>
    <td>45 per month</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Something else that's interesting is of those 5,500 visitors/13,000 page views, 66% are coming directly from google, 4% directly, then the other 30% from referrers. Those referrers are broken down into (from highest to lowest): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="http://blog.jagregory.com">my blog</a>, <a href="http://pnpguidance.net">pnpguidance.net</a>, <a href="http://nhforge.org">nhforge</a>, then quite a few other sites forming the lower percentages. I'm surprised at how high Stack Overflow is, I guess it pays that I pay attention to questions asked about Fluent on there.

Those download numbers are probably not representative either as they're only of the zip files, while I believe the vast majority of people run off the trunk through Subversion, so it's hard to count them.

            <p>It’s been two days since I <a href="/writings/introducing-docu-simple-doc-gen-for-net/">announced</a> <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com">docu</a>, my simple documentation generator for .Net apps.</p>

<p>The reception it’s received has been positive, I never expected it to have a surge of popularity because it’s not that kind of tool, so it hasn’t come as much of a surprise that people haven’t been jumping all over it. Having said that though, I have had some good feedback and already someone has contributed a patch. Additionally, there hasn’t been one question as to why I’ve created it; now this has come as a surprise, I guess I’m <strong>not</strong> the only one that feels Sandcastle is bloated and overcomplicated. Yay!</p>

<p>I’ve just pushed out some changes to the <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/docu">github repos</a> and released an updated alpha (v0.1.0.2) on the <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com/downloads">downloads page</a>. The biggest changes so far are the inclusion of events and fields in the parsing, which now means docu has <code>&lt;summary /&gt;</code> support for all documentable members. The rest of the changes are mainly refactorings and some battle-hardening.</p>

<p>I’ve got some more changes and several issues lined up, so keep an eye out.</p>

            <p>Lets look at a recent Twitter conversation of mine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anyone have any tips on generating html docs from XML comments? Used to do it years ago with NDoc <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1312895270'>?</a></li>

<li>Man, sandcastle is so overly complex <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313079815'>?</a></li>

<li>Sandcastle examples don&#8217;t even work. This is shit. <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313167377'>?</a></li>

<li>Why isn&#8217;t sandcastle just a console app that takes a list of dlls and spits out html/chm? What&#8217;s with all the batch files and XslTransforms? <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313112789'>?</a></li>

<li>@AndrewNStewart Well Sandcastle requires chaining together several calls to 3+ applications before you get anything. <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315443964'>?</a></li>

<li>Are these Sandcastle generated MSDN-style API docs actually useful to anyone? <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315364767'>?</a></li>

<li>@pollingj It&#8217;s a dilemma. I don&#8217;t care about API docs, but people seem to want it, but I&#8217;m reluctant to generate msdn-like shit. Dilemma. <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315455082'>?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So as you can see, dilemma. People want API documentation (for <a href='http://fluentnhibernate.org'>Fluent NHibernate</a> specifically), but I don&#8217;t want to associate myself with the awful MSDN-style documentation that&#8217;s produced by Sandcastle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before you get all hot under the collar, if you like Sandcastle, or you like MSDN-style documentation, leave now. Use what works for you, it doesn&#8217;t work for me so I&#8217;m not using it, but I don&#8217;t want to stop you using it.</p>

<p>I realise the market for this tool is probably pretty small, but it&#8217;s useful to me so it might be useful to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Introducing <a href='http://docu.jagregory.com'>docu</a>, the simple documentation generator for .Net!</p>

<p>Docu is a tool that produces an html site (or rather, a collection of html pages) from the doc-comments you include in your code. Given an assembly and the Visual Studio produced XML of the comments, docu will produce a completely static collection of pages that you can publish anywhere you like. You run it through one command-line tool, with one parameter. That&#8217;s it, nothing complicated.</p>

<p><code style="background: #CCC;color: #000;padding: 2px;">docu your-assembly.dll</code></p>

<p>You can see an example of the default style that&#8217;s provided in the Fluent NHibernate <a href='http://fluentnhibernate.org/api/index.htm'>API docs</a> (the colour scheme has been modified, but everything else is default).</p>

<p>Docu is completely stand alone, no GAC deployed assemblies, no hard-coded paths, no nothing. This makes it trivial to use docu in your CI process for building up-to-the-second API docs for publishing or downloading.</p>

<p>The templates that docu uses are created with the <a href='http://sparkviewengine.com'>Spark view engine</a> which means you have all the power of C# and it&#8217;s templating language at your finger-tips. If you&#8217;re particularly picky about appearance (like I am) then you can completely rewrite the templates to your heart&#8217;s content. There&#8217;s no imposed structure or style, it&#8217;s all customisable through the templates. You can read more about customising templates on the site: <a href='http://docu.jagregory.com/customising-templates'>customising templates</a>.</p>

<p>An interesting little feature of the templating system is <em>special names</em> for directories and files, for example if you name a template <code>!namespace.spark</code>, a html page will be produced for a each namespace in your assembly using that template. This allows you to do things like create a directory for each namespace, with a page for each type in that namespace inside. Pretty powerful!</p>

<p>The codebase is reasonably well structured, but the code itself is a bit untidy. Luckily it&#8217;s covered by nearly 200 unit tests (so far) and i&#8217;ll be leveraging them to improve the code quality over time. You can checkout the code from the <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/docu">docu github repo</a>.</p>

<p>It's early days yet, there's very little customisation of the documentation process (the part that actually finds the types and members to document), and not all comment types are supported yet; however, it's used for Fluent NHibernate and works pretty well. It's only Alpha right now, so you shouldn't expect the world.</p>

<p>So if this kind-of thing interests you, go have a read of the <a href='http://docu.jagregory.com'>docu website</a> and let me know how it works out for you.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/writings/fluent-nhibernate-conventions-rewrite">Fluent NHibernate: Conventions Rewrite</a></h2>
        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>I’ve just committed a rather large update to the Fluent NHibernate conventions code. This post explains why I’ve done this, and gives you some starting points to update your code. Anything else you need can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki">wiki</a> under <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Conventions">conventions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Converting-to-new-style-conventions">converting to new-style conventions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>So why have I rewritten conventions?</strong> Our original implementation was simple, but not really maintainable into the future. It was a single class that was a major violation of separation of concerns, and it just kept growing and growing. It didn’t gracefully degrade either; if we didn’t have the exact convention you needed it was tough luck, there was very little you could do short of modifying the code yourself.</p>

<p>Our original design worked something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WithConventions</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">conventions</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">conventions</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">TableName</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">type</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="s">"Table"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">conventions</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">DefaultLazy</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see, it’s a fairly simple design. Lambda functions were set that got called in various places throughout the mapping generation cycle. It was a good design for simple scenarios; however, when you start overriding more conventions, and introducing logic into them, it can quickly become a massive ball of mud. So while there was an initial simplicity to it, that simplicity was quickly lost if you were trying to do anything clever with it. This is another thing that the rewrite aims to solve.</p>

<p><strong>So how have things changed?</strong> The ability to define conventions inline is gone, for starters. Instead what you have is a series of interfaces of varying degrees of granularity; any classes implementing any of the interfaces will be automagically hooked into the mapping generation cycle. What this equates to is you’ll have a folder/namespace in your projects dedicated to conventions, each class making an alteration to the conventions when it’s called. As each convention is an interface, it means you can implement multiples of them in a single class, which allows you to group common conventions into a single class if you desire.</p>

<h2 id="example_customising_the_table_name">Example: Customising the table name</h2>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TableNameConvention</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">IClassConvention</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="nf">Accept</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IClassMap</span> <span class="k">class</span><span class="nc">Map</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// apply to all mappings
</span>  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Apply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IClassMap</span> <span class="k">class</span><span class="nc">Map</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// will produce table names like: tbl_Customer, tbl_Product
</span>    <span class="k">class</span><span class="nc">Map</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WithTable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"tbl_"</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="k">class</span><span class="nc">Map</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">EntityType</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is a simple implementation of the <code>IClassConvention</code> interface, which is applied to all class mappings (hence the <code>return true</code> in <code>Accept</code>) and simply prefixes the table name with <code>tbl_</code>.</p>

<h2 id="example_adding_your_conventions">Example: Adding your conventions</h2>

<p>There’s one thing you need to do to get Fluent NHibernate to use your conventions, and that’s to inform the convention discovery mechanism of where it’s to search for conventions. You do this using the <code>PersistenceModel</code>s <code>CovnentionFinder</code> property, or through the <code>ConventionDiscovery</code> property through <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/FluentConfiguration">Fluent Configuration</a>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Fluently</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Configure</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Mappings</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">FluentMappings</span>
      <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AddFromAssemblyOf</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">Entity</span><span class="p">&gt;()</span>
      <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ConventionDiscovery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AddFromAssemblyOf</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">MyConvention</span><span class="p">&gt;())</span>
  <span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That’s all there is to it really, certainly from a users perspective anyway. The architecture is designed in such a way that you have a much greater control of the granularity of your conventions; if you need a convention we haven’t explicitly supplied, you can use the convention “above” the one you want, and implement it yourself. If you need a convention for just Bag collections (which we don’t have one for), you just need to create an implementation of <code>IHasManyConvention</code> and limit it to bags. Easy.</p>

<h2 id="some_shortcuts">Some shortcuts</h2>

<p>I realise that the new design is more verbose than it was originally, and if your scenario really is one that only uses one or two conventions, then the new design might be too much for you. To cater for you people, I’ve created some basic inline support. I really don’t recommend you use these unless you’re doing something <em>really</em> simple. Separation is always preferred.</p>

<p>There’s the <code>ConventionBuilder</code> class which has several static properties (<code>Class</code> for example, there’s one for each convention) which allow you to create an inline convention.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ConventionBuilder</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Class</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Always</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">SetAttribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"something"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"true"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">ConventionBuilder</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Id</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Always</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ColumnName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"ID"</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="n">ConventionBuilder</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Property</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">When</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Property</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">PropertyType</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="k">typeof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">),</span>
  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ColumnName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Property</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="s">"Num"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These can be used directly in the <code>ConventionDiscovery</code> property mentioned above; it has an <code>Add</code> method that can take a params array of conventions, there’s also a <code>Setup</code> method which can be used for multiple additions.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ConventionDiscovery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Add</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">ConventionBuilder</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Class</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Always</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">SetAttribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"something"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"true"</span><span class="p">)),</span>

<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In addition to that, there’s a limited selection of very common conventions which can be used inline. Again, I don’t advocate using these for anything complicated. If you start having logic in your conventions, or even if the lambdas end up being multi-line, I’d suggest using the full conventions. These helpers live in the <code>FluentNHibernate.Conventions.Helpers</code> namespace.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Is</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">"tbl_"</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">EntityType</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">PrimaryKey</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Is</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"ID"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">DynamicUpdate</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">AlwaysTrue</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These can be used in the same way as the <code>ConventionBuilder</code> above.</p>

<h2 id="regarding_auto_mapping">Regarding auto mapping</h2>

<p>The auto mapper uses a small subset of conventions to discover various parts of your mappings. It was originally the case that these special conventions were lumped in with the rest of the conventions, even though you couldn’t use them outside of the automapper. As the old style conventions have gone, the automapper now has a separate set of conventions (they’re the same ones, just moved) that it uses. So in addition to the <code>ConventionDiscovery</code> property, the auto mapper has a <code>WithSetup</code> method that you can use to configure the auto mapping specific ones (<code>IsBaseType</code> primarily).</p>

<p>So this post should have given you a basic introduction to the changes I’ve made. To go further, you’re going to have to know what <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Available-conventions">interfaces are available</a> to implement. You should probably also read the <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Convertings">general conventions</a> wiki, how to <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Converting-to-new-style-conventions">convert your existing conventions</a> to the new style, and the <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Convention-shortcut">convention shortcuts</a> if it interests you. For maintainers, or just curious people, there’s also the wiki on how the <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/Conventions">conventions work behind-the-scenes</a>.</p>
