            <p>I think this is possibly something that everyone goes through at some point in their life, the desire to be more cultured. To me and most people this means going out and buying a lot of “classic” books and giving them a good going over. If you had tried to get me to do this a few years ago there would have been no chance of it happening, but it just so happens that I’m starting to get really into reading so this is a natural extension of things.</p>

            <p>Since getting my new job I’ve been rather quiet on the blogging side of things, mostly do to the fact that I’m actually doing something with my time rather than just sitting around tinkering. Strange I know, but you get used to it.</p>

<p>As you’d probably expect, I’m not really supposed to talk about what I do for security reasons of course. It’s mostly working for the Swift group (caravans, motorhomes) doing their internal systems and web sites. Other things as well, but it’s mainly that. It’s all very interesting, a big change from serving customers in a supermarket thats for sure. It’s a really strange feeling actually going to work and learning something, I generally come home every night having picked something new up.</p>

            <p>Debugging is a great thing… Often though I’ve dreamt of some greater, more useful debugger. It would have helped if I’d actually gone out and looked for such a thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, I haven’t found a better debugger. I’ve found how to use the current one better! I’ve enabled client-side script debugging, which is fantastic. No more using IE or Firefoxes vague error messages, I can now step through code just as you would VB/C#.Net. The big one for me though has to be the ability to debug Stored Procedures, yes SQL Server Stored Procedures. Breakpoints, step-through, the lot.</p>

            <p>I’m outta there, finally free from the bounds of a supermarket job. I’ve been taken in by Evolution Interactive, a web/multimedia design company.</p>

<p>I’m now a ‘New Media Developer’, nicer than ‘Checkout Assistant’ if I do say so my self. It’s very strange to be in a real job, doing something that I actually want to do (and like doing). This is going to take some getting used to…</p>

            <p>Upon receiving payment for my month of work, I promptly bought a new Amplifier for my musification; rendering me skint.</p>

<p>Thats not the point though, the amp is hot! Line 6 Spider II 210, not the biggest they make but big enough for me. It weighs a bloody tonne! This thing comes laden with 12 pre-defined tones, 4 custom presets and all the knobs you know you couldn’t live without.</p>
