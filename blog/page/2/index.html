    <div class="entry">
        <p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know, <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> is for helping you map entities with <a href="http://nhforge.org">NHibernate</a>. It&#8217;s based firmly on the practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">convention-over-configuration</a>, and can be used in a mapping-per-class style using our <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Fluent_mapping">fluent interface</a>, or let our <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Auto_mapping">automapper</a> map your entities itself.</p>

<p>This release introduces a few significant changes, and a lot of insignificant ones. You should refer to the <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0">1.0 release notes</a> for an overview of what&#8217;s changed.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org">wiki</a> has also been upgraded to use different software which should hopefully stop people being blocked, and make it a bit more stable; the upgrade included completely rewriting all of the pages, so don&#8217;t anyone say that it&#8217;s out of date.</p>

<p>You can get the binaries from the our <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads">downloads page</a>, or get the source from the <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate">github site</a>.</p>

<p>Special thanks go out to the Fluent NHibernate team, Paul Batum, Hudson Akridge, Andrew Stewart, and Stuart Childs. Each of them has put in time and effort above what was asked of them, and they&#8217;ve all felt guilty when not contributing, which is great. Thanks also to all the testers and contributors we&#8217;ve had over the months. Specifically Darko Conrad, for finding about 30 separate issues with the release candidiate; Everett Muniz and his subclasses, who now has a test of his own; and Kevin Dente, for deciding to moan about our method names only <em>after</em> months of work and a release candidate. I owe everyone beers if ever I&#8217;m in your area.</p>

<p>Fabio Maulo, Ayende, and the rest of the NHibernate team: Thanks for a great tool. NHibernate is a shining example of all that is good in open source in the .Net world.</p>

<p>&#8230;and with that, I&#8217;m going on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Sydney&daddr=Brisbane+to:Cairns&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&sll=-25.656382,152.880249&sspn=1.383954,1.851196&ie=UTF8&ll=-25.522615,152.358398&spn=22.065278,29.619141&z=5">holiday</a>.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/preventing-debugger-property-evaluation-side-effects/">Preventing Debugger Property Evaluation for Side-effect Laden Properties</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Property getters with side-effects, now there&#8217;s a controversial subject if ever I saw one. Don&#8217;t do it is the rule; as with any rule though, there&#8217;s generally an exception that proves it. If you&#8217;re in this situation and you genuinely do have a scenario that requires a property getter to have side-effects, then there&#8217;s a side-effect (ha!) that you should be aware of.</p>




<p><strong>The debugger evaluates property getters when showing it&#8217;s locals and autos windows.</strong> While this feature is indispensable in most cases, it plays havoc with our property-with-side-effects. What the debugger does is call the getter to present it&#8217;s value in the autos window, at the same time firing our code that has a side-effect. From there you have pretty confusing behavior with code seemingly running itself.</p>




<p>My exception to the rule is mutator properties in a fluent interface. You can often find properties in fluent interfaces that when touched alter the behavior of the next method called.</p>




<p>For example:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="k">value</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Null</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span><span class="p">)</span>      <span class="c1">// returns true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Not</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Null</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">// returns false</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>The Is class would contain a value tracking whether the next call would be inverted or not, and the Not property would flip that value when called.</p>




<p>Now assume this, you&#8217;re using <code>Is.Null(value)</code> and you set a breakpoint on it. Your autos window has expanded Is and shows the Not property, what&#8217;s just happened? The debugger has now called Not and altered your state! Undesirable.</p>




<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerbrowsableattribute.aspx">DebuggerBrowsable attribute</a> to the rescue; this attribute when used with the DebuggerBrowsableState.Never parameter instructs Visual Studio to never inspect the property you apply it to. Your property won&#8217;t appear in the autos or locals window, and if you expand the tree of an instance containing the property it will show up with a Browsing Disabled message; you can then force it to evaluate the property, but at least it doesn&#8217;t do it automatically.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">private</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">inverted</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="na">[DebuggerBrowsable(DebuggerBrowsableState.Never)]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Is</span> <span class="n">Not</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">get</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">inverted</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">!</span><span class="n">inverted</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Sticking the DebuggerBrowsable attribute on your Not property prevents the debugger from hitting it and inverting the switch.</p>




<p>So there you go, if your property-with-side-effects is being invoked by the debugger, you can use the DebuggerBrowsableAttribute to prevent it.</p>




<blockquote>By the way, I&#8217;m not advocating properties with side-effects&#8230;</blockquote>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>It&#8217;s nearly here, at long last <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> has nearly reached 1.0. Now starts the official public testing of our 1.0RC.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0">release notes</a> on the wiki for more information on what&#8217;s changed. There have been a lot of small breaking changes in the fluent interface, mostly reducing it&#8217;s verbosity, and a few larger changes elsewhere. Don&#8217;t expect to download this and have it <em>just work</em>, because it won&#8217;t; hopefully it shouldn&#8217;t be too painful though.</p>

<p>My plan is that this is a very quick turnaround for a release candidate. It&#8217;s already undergone some heavy testing from some respected volunteers, but I wanted to get it into the public eye for a week or so before release. Ideally the RTM release won&#8217;t differ from this one at all, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>You can find the binaries on our <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads">downloads page</a>, and it&#8217;s now included in the binary build releases too.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Cross-posted to <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jagregory/archive/2009/07/20/git-s-and-command-line-fear.aspx">Los Techies</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a> has been gaining a lot of traction lately, and rightly so. I&#8217;ve used it for a couple of years now, for all my projects (<a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> and <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com">Docu</a> being the prominent ones), but something that hasn&#8217;t changed is the tag-line of &#8220;but Windows support isn&#8217;t very good!&#8221;. What you quickly learn is that when people say that, they actually mean there isn&#8217;t a Visual Studio plug-in or some similar all-singing all-dancing GUI; this is a dire misrepresentation of Git, because it&#8217;s tooling on Windows is excellent if your definition of tooling includes the command-line.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s something ingrained in Windows developers, they hate the command-line. There&#8217;s a very good chance that if you encounter a Windows developer that does enjoy using the command-line it&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve also worked on another platform or in another environment that encourages command-line use (Rails is a good example). I&#8217;ve tried various ways of encouraging people to experiment, but very few work without being able to sit down and just show them something. It&#8217;s very much like R# adoption, nobody thinks it&#8217;ll speed them up until they see how fast someone else can be.</p>

<p>Back onto Git. If you don&#8217;t like what Git does, then that&#8217;s fine, but don&#8217;t label yourself as Alt.Net or a continuous improver if this sounds like you: &#8220;I define myself by choosing the best tool for each situation, but there&#8217;s no way you&#8217;ll get me using the command-line.&#8221; Way to go, oh open-minded one. Try it, you might like it.</p>

<p>The other techies have been posting some great <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/tags/git/default.aspx">Git posts</a> which can help you get up to speed. I hope to contribute, with less bile, soon.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/whats-been-happening-in-fluent-nhibernate-land/">What&#8217;s Been Happening in Fluent NHibernate Land?</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <blockquote>Cross-posted to <a href="http://jagregory.lostechies.com/archive/2009/04/28/what-s-been-happening-in-fluent-nhibernate-land.aspx">Los Techies</a></blockquote>


<p><a href="http://www.fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> has seen a flurry of development followed by a complete lack of commits, I figure it&#8217;s time to let everyone know what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p><strong>The Short Version</strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;re rewriting the internals. We have 100% of tests passing, but still can&#8217;t guarantee no regressions. Stuff may break, if it does, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate">tell us</a>. It&#8217;ll be worth it.</p>

<p><strong>The Long Version</strong></p>

<p>Once upon a time&#8230;</p>

<p>Fluent NHibernate at it&#8217;s core is a fluent interface over xml generation. We use the series of methods you call in your mappings to build up an in-memory hbm xml document that we then feed to NHibernate. Slowly, as we&#8217;ve started to support more and more of NHibernate&#8217;s features, we&#8217;ve started to find flaws in our architecture. It amounts to us not having enough separation of concerns; our fluent interface is generating xml, I think most people would say that&#8217;s not a good thing. Our xml is being generated too soon in the cycle to allow us to do more clever things that&#8217;d improve the user&#8217;s experience. That&#8217;s where the quiet time comes in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paulbatum.com">Paul Batum</a> undertook the task of redesigning the internals of Fluent NHibernate to be something much more scalable. I&#8217;ll leave the details out for now (maybe a future post), but it amounts to a intermediary layer being introduced between the fluent interface and the xml generation. We&#8217;ve dubbed this the Semantic Model, and it&#8217;s that which is now generated by the fluent interface, then later translated into xml. This added abstraction allows us to do things that weren&#8217;t possible while we were just generating straight xml.</p>

<p>Whilst you wont see any immediate improvements while everything is being converted, the extra layer allows us to inspect the model before it is converted to xml; this gives us some immense capabilities, such as allowing subclasses to be separate from their parent mapping, create reusable component mappings, improve relationship support etc&#8230; We&#8217;re pretty much limited only by what we can imagine now, rather than by architectural decisions.</p>

<p>However, we have a dilemma. The semantic-model branch has deviated so much from trunk we&#8217;ve got a major merge problem. A merge is pretty much out of the question actually, because there&#8217;s barely any commonality between the two streams at all. It was then assumed that the branch would eventually replace trunk (we&#8217;d just rename trunk to a tag, then rename the semantic-model branch to trunk), and all we needed to do was get the branch up-to-date with the features of trunk. Little did we realise we were essentially committing to something that I typically oppose, a complete rewrite! I&#8217;ve never been in a situation where that&#8217;s ever been a good idea, and yet here we are, responsible for our own destiny as it was, and we&#8217;d chosen a rewrite!</p>

<p>A few weeks went by with very little work happening. I think we&#8217;d all started feeling demoralised by the idea of re-implementing most of the features from trunk using the new design. It was a worthwhile endeavor, definitely, but just very uninteresting. We repeatedly swore that we&#8217;d get this done, but all the while we felt less inclined to support trunk because every new feature meant a new feature to port too. We stopped.</p>

<p>At that point <a href="http://www.bestguesstheory.com/">Hudson Akridge</a>, our newest contributor, had the balls to tell me that he thought what we were doing felt pretty futile. At that moment I gained a great deal of respect for him, as it&#8217;s something that was in the back of my mind for some time but I wasn&#8217;t ready to face yet. It was that which got me moving again.</p>

<p>I sat down over a long weekend and took on the mammoth task of merging our rewrite branch and trunk, with the aim of allowing the existing code to exist alongside the new code; this approach, if it worked, would allow us to convert existing features at our own pace while still writing new features for the cleaner codebase. After a lot of unpleasant hacking of nice code, I managed to get all our existing tests passing while utilising the semantic model behind the scenes. Our old code still directly generates xml, which then gets injected into the semantic model via a nasty shortcut. It feels dirty, because I&#8217;ve had to comprimise some good code to get it working, but in a way I think that&#8217;s a good thing; if code is nasty, we&#8217;re all less likely to be content with it. The main goal was achieved though, and that was to allow us to work at our own pace on trunk.</p>

<p>Where we stand now is three branches, trunk, integration, and semantic-model. Over the next day or so I am going to merge integration with trunk, which will mean the semantic model will be in use for new features. From there we can slowly migrate all the original code to use our new semantic model, all the while adding new features using it, then eventually remove the duct-tape that&#8217;s holding the legacy code to the new code and dump the old stuff.</p>

<p>This is where I&#8217;ll give you a little warning: although we have 100% of tests passing, we don&#8217;t have 100% coverage. There may be some regressions that we aren&#8217;t aware of. If anyone finds anything broken that was working before, contact us immediately on the <a href="groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate">mailing list</a> or via the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/issues/list">issues list</a> and we&#8217;ll correct it. Regressions will be treated with the highest priority over any other work.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it, you now know more about what&#8217;s happening with Fluent NHibernate than you ever wanted to. I hope this sheds a little light onto what&#8217;s been happening with us, and perhaps why your patch hasn&#8217;t been applied as quickly as you would&#8217;ve liked.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/fluent-nhibernate-usage-stats/">Fluent NHibernate Usage Stats</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        Just been totting up some figures on how <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> is doing, thought I&#8217;d share them with anyone that&#8217;s interested.

<blockquote>These are very rough figures, generated with no scientific consistency, some are cumulative and others are based just on the last full month. They&#8217;re more just to satisfy my curiosity than to be rigorously accurate.</blockquote>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Downloads</td>
    <td>1,800 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unique visitors</td>
    <td>5,500 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Page views</td>
    <td>13,000 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mailing list messages</td>
    <td>450 per month</td>
  <tr>
    <td>Commits</td>
    <td>45 per month</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Something else that&#8217;s interesting is of those 5,500 visitors/13,000 page views, 66% are coming directly from google, 4% directly, then the other 30% from referrers. Those referrers are broken down into (from highest to lowest): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="http://blog.jagregory.com">my blog</a>, <a href="http://pnpguidance.net">pnpguidance.net</a>, <a href="http://nhforge.org">nhforge</a>, then quite a few other sites forming the lower percentages. I&#8217;m surprised at how high Stack Overflow is, I guess it pays that I pay attention to questions asked about Fluent on there.

Those download numbers are probably not representative either as they&#8217;re only of the zip files, while I believe the vast majority of people run off the trunk through Subversion, so it&#8217;s hard to count them.

    <div class="entry">
        <p>It&#8217;s been two days since I <a href="/writings/introducing-docu-simple-doc-gen-for-net/">announced</a> <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com">docu</a>, my simple documentation generator for .Net apps.</p>

<p>The reception it&#8217;s received has been positive, I never expected it to have a surge of popularity because it&#8217;s not that kind of tool, so it hasn&#8217;t come as much of a surprise that people haven&#8217;t been jumping all over it. Having said that though, I have had some good feedback and already someone has contributed a patch. Additionally, there hasn&#8217;t been one question as to why I&#8217;ve created it; now this has come as a surprise, I guess I&#8217;m <strong>not</strong> the only one that feels Sandcastle is bloated and overcomplicated. Yay!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just pushed out some changes to the <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/docu">github repos</a> and released an updated alpha (v0.1.0.2) on the <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com/downloads">downloads page</a>. The biggest changes so far are the inclusion of events and fields in the parsing, which now means docu has <code>&lt;summary /&gt;</code> support for all documentable members. The rest of the changes are mainly refactorings and some battle-hardening.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got some more changes and several issues lined up, so keep an eye out.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Lets look at a recent Twitter conversation of mine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anyone have any tips on generating html docs from XML comments? Used to do it years ago with NDoc <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1312895270'>?</a></li>

<li>Man, sandcastle is so overly complex <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313079815'>?</a></li>

<li>Sandcastle examples don&#8217;t even work. This is shit. <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313167377'>?</a></li>

<li>Why isn&#8217;t sandcastle just a console app that takes a list of dlls and spits out html/chm? What&#8217;s with all the batch files and XslTransforms? <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313112789'>?</a></li>

<li>@AndrewNStewart Well Sandcastle requires chaining together several calls to 3+ applications before you get anything. <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315443964'>?</a></li>

<li>Are these Sandcastle generated MSDN-style API docs actually useful to anyone? <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315364767'>?</a></li>

<li>@pollingj It&#8217;s a dilemma. I don&#8217;t care about API docs, but people seem to want it, but I&#8217;m reluctant to generate msdn-like shit. Dilemma. <a href='http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315455082'>?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So as you can see, dilemma. People want API documentation (for <a href='http://fluentnhibernate.org'>Fluent NHibernate</a> specifically), but I don&#8217;t want to associate myself with the awful MSDN-style documentation that&#8217;s produced by Sandcastle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before you get all hot under the collar, if you like Sandcastle, or you like MSDN-style documentation, leave now. Use what works for you, it doesn&#8217;t work for me so I&#8217;m not using it, but I don&#8217;t want to stop you using it.</p>

<p>I realise the market for this tool is probably pretty small, but it&#8217;s useful to me so it might be useful to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Introducing <a href='http://docu.jagregory.com'>docu</a>, the simple documentation generator for .Net!</p>

<p>Docu is a tool that produces an html site (or rather, a collection of html pages) from the doc-comments you include in your code. Given an assembly and the Visual Studio produced XML of the comments, docu will produce a completely static collection of pages that you can publish anywhere you like. You run it through one command-line tool, with one parameter. That&#8217;s it, nothing complicated.</p>

<p><code style="background: #CCC;color: #000;padding: 2px;">docu your-assembly.dll</code></p>

<p>You can see an example of the default style that&#8217;s provided in the Fluent NHibernate <a href='http://fluentnhibernate.org/api/index.htm'>API docs</a> (the colour scheme has been modified, but everything else is default).</p>

<p>Docu is completely stand alone, no GAC deployed assemblies, no hard-coded paths, no nothing. This makes it trivial to use docu in your CI process for building up-to-the-second API docs for publishing or downloading.</p>

<p>The templates that docu uses are created with the <a href='http://sparkviewengine.com'>Spark view engine</a> which means you have all the power of C# and it&#8217;s templating language at your finger-tips. If you&#8217;re particularly picky about appearance (like I am) then you can completely rewrite the templates to your heart&#8217;s content. There&#8217;s no imposed structure or style, it&#8217;s all customisable through the templates. You can read more about customising templates on the site: <a href='http://docu.jagregory.com/customising-templates'>customising templates</a>.</p>

<p>An interesting little feature of the templating system is <em>special names</em> for directories and files, for example if you name a template <code>!namespace.spark</code>, a html page will be produced for a each namespace in your assembly using that template. This allows you to do things like create a directory for each namespace, with a page for each type in that namespace inside. Pretty powerful!</p>

<p>The codebase is reasonably well structured, but the code itself is a bit untidy. Luckily it&#8217;s covered by nearly 200 unit tests (so far) and i&#8217;ll be leveraging them to improve the code quality over time. You can checkout the code from the <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/docu">docu github repo</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s early days yet, there&#8217;s very little customisation of the documentation process (the part that actually finds the types and members to document), and not all comment types are supported yet; however, it&#8217;s used for Fluent NHibernate and works pretty well. It&#8217;s only Alpha right now, so you shouldn&#8217;t expect the world.</p>

<p>So if this kind-of thing interests you, go have a read of the <a href='http://docu.jagregory.com'>docu website</a> and let me know how it works out for you.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/fluent-nhibernate-conventions-rewrite/">Fluent NHibernate: Conventions Rewrite</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>I&#8217;ve just committed a rather large update to the Fluent NHibernate conventions code. This post explains why I&#8217;ve done this, and gives you some starting points to update your code. Anything else you need can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki">wiki</a> under <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Conventions">conventions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Converting-to-new-style-conventions">converting to new-style conventions</a>.</p>




<p><strong>So why have I rewritten conventions?</strong> Our original implementation was simple, but not really maintainable into the future. It was a single class that was a major violation of separation of concerns, and it just kept growing and growing. It didn&#8217;t gracefully degrade either; if we didn&#8217;t have the exact convention you needed it was tough luck, there was very little you could do short of modifying the code yourself.</p>




<p>Our original design worked something like this:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">WithConventions</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">conventions</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">conventions</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">TableName</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">type</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;Table&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">conventions</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">DefaultLazy</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s a fairly simple design. Lambda functions were set that got called in various places throughout the mapping generation cycle. It was a good design for simple scenarios; however, when you start overriding more conventions, and introducing logic into them, it can quickly become a massive ball of mud. So while there was an initial simplicity to it, that simplicity was quickly lost if you were trying to do anything clever with it. This is another thing that the rewrite aims to solve.</p>




<p><strong>So how have things changed?</strong> The ability to define conventions inline is gone, for starters. Instead what you have is a series of interfaces of varying degrees of granularity; any classes implementing any of the interfaces will be automagically hooked into the mapping generation cycle. What this equates to is you&#8217;ll have a folder/namespace in your projects dedicated to conventions, each class making an alteration to the conventions when it&#8217;s called. As each convention is an interface, it means you can implement multiples of them in a single class, which allows you to group common conventions into a single class if you desire.</p>




<h2 id="example_customising_the_table_name">Example: Customising the table name</h2>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>This is a simple implementation of the <code>IClassConvention</code> interface, which is applied to all class mappings (hence the <code>return true</code> in <code>Accept</code>) and simply prefixes the table name with <code>tbl_</code>.</p>




<h2 id="example_adding_your_conventions">Example: Adding your conventions</h2>




<p>There&#8217;s one thing you need to do to get Fluent NHibernate to use your conventions, and that&#8217;s to inform the convention discovery mechanism of where it&#8217;s to search for conventions. You do this using the <code>PersistenceModel</code>s <code>CovnentionFinder</code> property, or through the <code>ConventionDiscovery</code> property through <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/FluentConfiguration">Fluent Configuration</a>.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it really, certainly from a users perspective anyway. The architecture is designed in such a way that you have a much greater control of the granularity of your conventions; if you need a convention we haven&#8217;t explicitly supplied, you can use the convention &#8220;above&#8221; the one you want, and implement it yourself. If you need a convention for just Bag collections (which we don&#8217;t have one for), you just need to create an implementation of <code>IHasManyConvention</code> and limit it to bags. Easy.</p>




<h2 id="some_shortcuts">Some shortcuts</h2>




<p>I realise that the new design is more verbose than it was originally, and if your scenario really is one that only uses one or two conventions, then the new design might be too much for you. To cater for you people, I&#8217;ve created some basic inline support. I really don&#8217;t recommend you use these unless you&#8217;re doing something <em>really</em> simple. Separation is always preferred.</p>




<p>There&#8217;s the <code>ConventionBuilder</code> class which has several static properties (<code>Class</code> for example, there&#8217;s one for each convention) which allow you to create an inline convention.</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>These can be used directly in the <code>ConventionDiscovery</code> property mentioned above; it has an <code>Add</code> method that can take a params array of conventions, there&#8217;s also a <code>Setup</code> method which can be used for multiple additions.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>In addition to that, there&#8217;s a limited selection of very common conventions which can be used inline. Again, I don&#8217;t advocate using these for anything complicated. If you start having logic in your conventions, or even if the lambdas end up being multi-line, I&#8217;d suggest using the full conventions. These helpers live in the <code>FluentNHibernate.Conventions.Helpers</code> namespace.</p>

<p>These can be used in the same way as the <code>ConventionBuilder</code> above.</p>




<h2 id="regarding_auto_mapping">Regarding auto mapping</h2>




<p>The auto mapper uses a small subset of conventions to discover various parts of your mappings. It was originally the case that these special conventions were lumped in with the rest of the conventions, even though you couldn&#8217;t use them outside of the automapper. As the old style conventions have gone, the automapper now has a separate set of conventions (they&#8217;re the same ones, just moved) that it uses. So in addition to the <code>ConventionDiscovery</code> property, the auto mapper has a <code>WithSetup</code> method that you can use to configure the auto mapping specific ones (<code>IsBaseType</code> primarily).</p>




<h2 id="further_reading">Further reading</h2>




<p>So this post should have given you a basic introduction to the changes I&#8217;ve made. To go further, you&#8217;re going to have to know what <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Available-conventions">interfaces are available</a> to implement. You should probably also read the <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Convertings">general conventions</a> wiki, how to <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Converting-to-new-style-conventions">convert your existing conventions</a> to the new style, and the <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Convention-shortcut">convention shortcuts</a> if it interests you. For maintainers, or just curious people, there&#8217;s also the wiki on how the <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/Conventions">conventions work behind-the-scenes</a>.</p>
