    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/a-usability-moan-about-adobes-website/">A Usability Moan About Adobe&#8217;s Website</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>When recently performing a system-wide clean-out, I removed a long-expired Macromedia Flash 8 Studio trial. Unknown to me at the time, it had taken it upon itself to remove the flash player as-well; because, of course, now that I don’t want to develop flash, I’ll never need it again!</p>

<p>Anyway, a week or so later I discovered that I needed to re-install the player, so off I went to <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe’s Website</a>. When I arrived, I was presented with a fairly reasonable page - in terms of design - but there was something on there that epitomises the lack of thought that goes into usability on the web. People, you have to remember it isn’t just about how you create your links (bad “click here”, no play-time for you!), it’s also about how your content is worded.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adobe-flash-small.jpg" alt="Adobe's no-flash warning message" /></p>

<p>What you can see in the screenshot is what you’re shown if you don’t have the flash player installed (or JavaScript enabled, I’m guessing).</p>

<p>What’s wrong with this picture?</p>

<p>It’s very misleading, that’s what.</p>

<p>The heading is asking me “Can’t see this content?”, but I can, can’t I? I’m reading it! Oh, the word “this” isn’t associated to what I’m reading (as it should be), but rather what I’m <strong>not</strong> reading. Interesting.</p>

<p>Misleading text has also found its way into the body content, once again, I am reading the content aren’t I? Another thing is that the content also implies that I have JavaScript disabled when I actually don’t. I believe you’re statistically more likely to have a user without flash installed, than without JavaScript enabled. So with that in mind, it would have been a better idea to ask if they have flash first then ask about JavaScript. Even better would be to do a check to see if JavaScript is enabled, if it is you don’t need to display that part of the message at all!</p>

<p>One last thing, those controls at the bottom; what are they doing there? I know (now) that they’re there because the content that’s supposed to be showing is a movie, but prior to having that knowledge surely they just reinforce the feeling that I am seeing what I’m supposed to. I have content, I have play controls, hey why aren’t they working? They serve no purpose apart from to confuse the user.</p>

<h2>A slightly better picture</h2>

<p>I’ve modified the content to be - in my eyes - a bit more respectable. It still isn’t perfect, like I said above, some JavaScript detection would be nice. Here it is non-the-less though:</p>

<p><img src="/images/adobe-flash-fixed.gif" alt="An improved version of Adobe's message" /></p>

<p>“Reading this?”</p>

<p>I most certainly am.</p>

<p>“If you are reading this message, then you are unable to view our active content.”</p>

<p>Oh dear, so that’s what this is all about. How do I fix it?</p>

<p>“Please either download the latest version of the Macromedia Flash Player or enable JavaScript in your browser.”</p>

<p>Will do, thanks for the help Mr. Usable Information Box.</p>

    <article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/your-forms-are-killing-me/">Your Forms Are Killing Me</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <blockquote><p>Note: I have no particular dislike of the website in question, in fact I read it on a regular basis, but what I’m about to talk about is a travesty. Although it does tie in rather nicely with a previous post of mine: <a href="/writings/bloated-forms">Bloated Forms</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was browsing one of my regular watering holes (water of knowledge, of course!) - <a href="http://www.theserverside.net">The Server Side.Net</a> - and I felt the overwhelming urge to make a reply in the forum. Registration was required, of course, so off to register I went. What followed was purely horrible on so many levels.</p>

<h2>Step One</h2>

<p><img src="/images/tss-first.gif" alt="First form" /></p>

<p>I was first presented with the rather humble request of entering my e-mail address, nothing un-expected here and to be honest, quite refreshing in its simplicity. I thought I may just receive an e-mail with a pre-generated password and that’d be it… but it wasn’t to be.</p>

<h2>Step Two</h2>

<p><img src="/images/tss-second.gif" alt="Second form" /></p>

<p>Next was a list of ten check boxes for various newsletters I could subscribe to. I don’t know how many people actually use these “features” of registration forms, but I just wanted to register. If I wanted to receive newsletters I would opt-in from within my account once registered. In their defence, the checkboxes did at least default to false!</p>

<blockquote><p>On a side note, how is it not understood that you should give the user as little to deal with as possible? Especially when you’re trying to get them to sign-up to your services, you should get them in as quickly as possible, no fuss, no mess and people won’t lose interest.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Step Three</h2>

<p><img src="/images/tss-third.gif" alt="Third form" /></p>

<p>This one is a whopper, scarily so. Baring in mind that all I want to do is make one post on their forum, this seems a tad excessive.</p>

<p>Firstly they want my first and last name, fair enough but I’d say even just my name, singular, would suffice. Next are my Company Name and my Title at said company, followed by my full address, postal code, telephone number and fax number. These are a bit odd, especially considering I might be unemployed and/or unwilling to disclose such information.</p>

<p>Based on what the next sections were, <a href="http://www.theserverside.net">The Server Side</a> are seriously interested in <strong>my</strong> company. They’re asking such in-depth questions as what my IT budget is, how many employees are at the company, how many of those are developers, the purchasing scope and the industry of my organisation. Woah. Who even knows that stuff? Never mind wants to disclose it.</p>

<p>Finally I get to choose which technologies are relevant to me, via another big list of checkboxes.</p>

<p>As if that huge list wasn’t bad enough, to put the proverbial icing on the cake, 90% of the fields are <strong>mandatory</strong>! Yes, even the IT Budget and Purchasing Scope. Absolute madness!</p>

<h2>Step Four</h2>

<p><img src="/images/tss-fourth.gif" alt="Fourth form" /></p>

<p>Yes, there’s more. This is merely a finalisation of my e-mail and a password. Nothing fancy.</p>

<h2>The End</h2>

<p>When I encountered step three, all I thought of was targeted advertising; something I definitely do not want to be a part of. I’m shocked to be honest, it’s a sad state of affairs when so much information needs to be gathered just to allow simple forum/comment posting.</p>

<p>I didn’t make it past the form - The Server Side has lost my gems of wisdom.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/using-ies-conditional-comments-for-targeted-javascript/">Using Internet Explorer&#8217;s Conditional Comments for Targeted JavaScript</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">demise of CSS hacks</a>, something which has been covered elsewhere to no end, definitely a good thing, but not what I’m covering here - not directly anyway. I’ve been wondering if we can take advantage of this new age of “hack segregation”.</p>

<p>The way I see it is we’re already breaking the rule of separation by using conditional comments in the structure, so why don’t we cease this opportunity to save our friends (users of Firefox, Safari, Opera etc&#8230;) some bandwidth by providing IE specific JavaScript in the same way too?</p>

<p>For those wondering what I could mean by “IE specific JavaScript”, an example would be simulating the CSS focus pseudo class on form elements - something highly recommended for an accessible and usable form - which aren’t implemented in the market standard versions of Internet Explorer (6 and below).</p>

<p>I don’t think users of compliant browsers should be punished by downloading extraneous scripts, loading events into the queue and then spending time evaluating code that doesn’t even apply to them.</p>

<p>I’m proposing that we devote a section of the page <code>head</code> tag to Internet Explorer, that’s simply a conditional comment section that contains any style sheets and script blocks that only apply to IE.</p>

<h2>Example 1 (what we are doing)</h2>

<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Example 2 (what we could be doing)</h2>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;!--[if lt IE 7]&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/css/ie-specific.css&quot; /&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/ie-specific.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">  addEvent(window, &#39;load&#39;, doIEStuff);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">&lt;![endif]--&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In <em>Example 1</em> only Internet Explorer (prior to version 7) will download the stylesheet, but all browsers download the “ie-specific.js” JavaScript file and evaluate the <code>addEvent</code> code block. However if we follow <em>Example 2</em>, Internet Explorer will download the JavaScript and CSS just like normal, but other browsers simply see the whole section as a standard html comment and thus won’t download anything or evaluate the code block.</p>

<p>Wonderful, eh? I feel more comfortable with this approach than using questionable browser detection methods in JavaScript and it also reinforces (by just a tiny little bit) that compliant browsers are faster than their non-compliant brethren.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>I don’t know what it is, but there seems to be an inherent urge of web developers (or designers, managers or whomever) to create forms that are hugely bloated and pointless, even for simple things such as sending a contact e-mail.</p>

<p>This fascination with bloated forms is incomprehensible to me, I just can’t understand why anybody would want to know the gender or official title of somebody who’s simply trying to say “Hello”; it’s irrelevant, all I personally care about is what they’ve got to say. Is it supposed to portray the company in an intelligent, professional manner? (<em>These people want my title, they obviously mean business!</em>) I don’t know, but it needs to stop.</p>

<p>I personally am a lot less inclined to fill out a form if it feels like an interrogation. Contact forms should consist of me entering my name, some form of contact information and my brain-dump - nothing else!</p>

<h2>Fairly standard form</h2>

<p><img src="/images/form-bad.png" alt="Bad form layout" /></p>

<h2>Suggested form</h2>

<p><img src="/images/form-good.png" alt="Good form layout" /></p>

<p>I know which one I’d prefer.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>We’ve been sending out a (rather successful) e-mail campaign for <a href="http://www.swiftleisure.co.uk">Swift</a> over the past few days, a good experience and definitely an eye opener. Something that amused me over the course of the project was the way people were using the “Recommend a Friend” feature of the e-mail.</p>

<p>If you’re presented by a form, which asks for your friends name, e-mail address and some form of comment from yourself, what would you put in the name field? Common sense says that you should put their full name in, as generally that’s what people want; not these people though! Over 50% of the recommendations were supplied with first names only or nicknames - the most wonderful being “MUM”; yes, block capitals too.</p>

<p>So we have a nice collection of recommendations along the lines of:</p>

<ol>
    <li>George</li>
    <li>Sally</li>
    <li>Geoff</li>
    <li>liz</li>
    <li>MUM</li>
</ol>


<p>How very helpful.</p>

<p>They’ll love the targeted e-mails they’re bound to receive too; “Dear MUM, we think…”.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/sql-server-object-exists-function/">SQL Server Object Exists Function</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <blockquote><p><strong>Update:</strong> Added separate versions for SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005, due to the differences in the system objects tables.It may just be me, but when writing migration/create scripts for use with SQL Server I get quite agitated at having to write an ugly, long-winded, drop statement at the start of every object definition.</p></blockquote>

<p>The support for dropping objects is one of the few things I would say MySQL has SQL Server over the barrel for.Baring in mind that if you try to drop an object that doesn’t exist, you’ll get an execution error; here’s how to drop a table in MySQL:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">DROP</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">IF</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span> <span class="n">customers</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here’s how to drop the same table, if you’re using SQL Server:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="n">IF</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">objects</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">OBJECT_ID</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">OBJECT_ID</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="s1">&#39;customers&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="k">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="s1">&#39;U&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>    <span class="k">DROP</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">customers</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As always, when something annoys you enough and you’re in the middle of something else, it’s about time you wrote that solution. So I’ve created a simple user-defined function that checks if an object exists then returns a <code>BIT 0</code> or <code>1</code> depending.</p>

<p>To use the function, all you have to do is call <code>dbo.ObjectExists</code> with two parameters, the first being the name of the object you want to check on, the second being the type of object.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="n">IF</span> <span class="n">dbo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ObjectExists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;customers&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;U&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">DROP</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">customers</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<dl>
  <dt>Common Object Types:</dt>
  <dd><code>P</code> - Stored Procedure</dd>
  <dd><code>U</code> - User Table</dd>
  <dd><code>FN</code> - User-Defined Function</dd>
</dl>


<p>Thanks to this little function, you can now almost match the simplicity of MySQL.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Just a quick tip to enable the Debug menu in Safari, the main reason being to get the JavaScript Console (ala Firefox).</p>

<p>Simply close down your open instances of Safari and enter this into the Terminal:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu 1
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That’ll enable a new Debug menu next time you start Safari, simple as that. I was on the verge of loading up Firefox on the Mac
before I came across this, bad James!</p>

<p>Also, just in-case, running the above again with 0 will turn off the menu.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/ruby-on-rails-recognition-failed-in-production-mode/">Ruby on Rails Recognition Failed in Production Mode</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>The title pretty much covers it, but i’ll elaborate.</p>

<p>A few days ago I decided it was about time I had a tinker with <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps">Google Sitemaps</a>, part of which involves uploading a temporary file so google can be sure the website you’re trying to claim is actually yours. Anyway, fun things aside, google gave me an error message (“We’ve detected that your 404 (file not found) error page returns a status of 200 (OK) in the header.”) when it tried to read the file.</p>

<p>The error message was caused by a feature of Ruby on Rails, which when in Development mode, invalid pages are still served by Rails and sent with a 200 header, but logged as having a Routing error of “Recognition failed”.</p>

<p>All information pointed to a simple fix of setting the rails environment (<code>ENV['RAILS_ENV']</code>) to production mode, which would disable the aforementioned feature. Unfortunately for me, my environment was <em>already</em> set to production! I double checked this, logged into the ruby console on my web-server and checked the variables, then even checked which log file was being written to; everything was pointing to it being in production mode.</p>

<p>After a lot of browsing of forums and chatting in IRC channels, I succumbed to randomly trying anything, which is when i noticed in my environment.rb file there was a line of code that I couldn’t for the life of me remember why it was in there, or what it was doing; removing this line of code worked a treat, everything snapped back to how it should be functioning.</p>

<p>For future reference, the line in question was:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;error_handler_basic&#39;</span> <span class="c1"># defines AC::Base#rescue_action_in_public</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So there you go, now I have a 404 page and google accepted my site map, so we can all live happily ever after.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>I apparently got around to reading <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com">Coding Horror</a> a bit too late, as I missed <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000329.html" title="Uncrippling Windows XP's IIS 5.1">this gem</a>. It’s an article about a small application used to bend XP’s IIS to your every whim, perfect for those of us suffering at the hands of Microsoft.</p>

<p>The basic gist of the application is that it removes the limits of XP’s IIS, namely the problem of only being allowed one website and 10 concurrent users. It takes a bit of getting used to, especially if you’re using Visual Studio; if you are, remember to reset IIS to it’s default website before opening a website created prior to using IISAdmin.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/servercontrolids-update/">ServerControlIDs Update</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>I’ve created a small update for my ServerControlIDs control, which removes the problem caused by controls within Repeaters and DataGrid.</p>

<p>If you had a repeater that for each item contained an Hyperlink control, you’d get a duplicate entry in the ClientIDs object for every record, to avoid this problem I simply don’t output any sub-controls from within repeater style objects.</p>

<p>That may sound like a bit of a hack, maybe it is, but if you want to refer to multiple elements within another, you shouldn’t really be doing it by ID anyway.</p>

<p>You can get the <a href="http://www.jagregory.com/downloads/ServerControlIDs-1.1.zip">updated source here</a> or view the <a href="/writings/how-to-use-clientids-in-javascript-without-the-ugliness/" title="ASP.Net ClientIDs and their JavaScript companion">full article here</a>.</p>
