Once again the guys at Mozilla have broken quite possibly the best plug-in for Firefox: the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/">Venkman Javascript Debugger</a>. This is becoming quite commonplace, with every update for firefox disabling the debugger until a fix is released.

Anyway, even though both the extensions manager and Venkmans official website both say there arenâ€™t any updates available, Joe Walker from <a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/home">Getahead</a> has created and update that contains some bug fixes from Bugzilla, but most importantly Venkman now works with Firefox 1.5.0.1!
