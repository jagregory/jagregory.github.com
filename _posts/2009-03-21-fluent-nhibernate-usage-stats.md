I've just been totting up some figures on how [Fluent NHibernate](http://fluentnhibernate.org) is doing, thought I'd share them with anyone that's interested.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Downloads</td>
    <td>1,800 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unique visitors</td>
    <td>5,500 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Page views</td>
    <td>13,000 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mailing list messages</td>
    <td>450 per month</td>
  <tr>
    <td>Commits</td>
    <td>45 per month</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Something else that's interesting is of those 5,500 visitors/13,000 page views, 66% are coming directly from google, 4% directly, then the other 30% from referrers. Those referrers are broken down into (from highest to lowest): [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), [my blog](http://www.jagregory.com), [pnpguidance.net](http://pnpguidance.net), [nhforge](http://nhforge.org), then quite a few other sites forming the lower percentages. I'm surprised at how high Stack Overflow is, I guess it pays that I pay attention to questions asked about Fluent on there.

Those download numbers are probably not representative either as they're only of the zip files, while I believe the vast majority of people run off the trunk through Subversion, so it's hard to count them.
