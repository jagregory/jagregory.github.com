As reported by [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/), a new set of [accessibility guidelines](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4783686.stm) have been developed for UK websites.

Although this certainly isn't anything new — being as a law was passed in 1999 for compliance — and it isn't even legally binding, it may be used in court if a case arises. This is just one more little pebble added to the mounting landslide that will occur when a disabled user finally does the american thing and sues a company for not providing sufficient means to access their website.
