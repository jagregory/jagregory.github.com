It's been two days since I <a href="/writings/introducing-docu-simple-doc-gen-for-net/">announced</a> <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com">docu</a>, my simple documentation generator for .Net apps.

The reception it's received has been positive, I never expected it to have a surge of popularity because it's not that kind of tool, so it hasn't come as much of a surprise that people haven't been jumping all over it. Having said that though, I have had some good feedback and already someone has contributed a patch. Additionally, there hasn't been one question as to why I've created it; now this has come as a surprise, I guess I'm <strong>not</strong> the only one that feels Sandcastle is bloated and overcomplicated. Yay!

I've just pushed out some changes to the <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/docu">github repos</a> and released an updated alpha (v0.1.0.2) on the <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com/downloads">downloads page</a>. The biggest changes so far are the inclusion of events and fields in the parsing, which now means docu has <code>&lt;summary /&gt;</code> support for all documentable members. The rest of the changes are mainly refactorings and some battle-hardening.

I've got some more changes and several issues lined up, so keep an eye out.
