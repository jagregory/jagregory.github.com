I think this is possibly something that everyone goes through at some point in their life, the desire to be more cultured. To me and most people this means going out and buying a lot of “classic” books and giving them a good going over. If you had tried to get me to do this a few years ago there would have been no chance of it happening, but it just so happens that I'm starting to get really into reading so this is a natural extension of things.

I've got my self the following books, anybody with any suggestions feel free to drop me a comment or e-mail.

  * Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)
  * Heart Of Darkness (Joseph Conrad)
  * Animal Farm (George Orwell)
  * Catch-22 (Joseph Heller)
  * Gulliver's Travels (Jonathan Swift)
  * Fahrenheit 451 (Ray Bradbury)

For something a little different I also got The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud, a slight change of pace.

I've nearly finished reading Heart of Darkness, not taken long really. Not surprising considering it's only 100 pages long, I can't say it's had a huge impact on me. I may be missing the point completely but nothing really seems to have happened and I'm onto the 3rd chapter (of 3). None the less the point is that I've now read a piece of history and have an informed opinion of it rather than just hints of what it's about from what I've picked up listening to other people.
