> Note from Future James: I'm leaving this here because it's cute and my first blog post (at least
> on this domain). Don't judge me on the banality of it.

I'm back again (I know this post is a bit late), my ex-host returned my domain name to the registrar and I've had to re-jiggle things to get it pointed at the right place.

It all happened something like this:

  1. Web-host returns domain name.
  2. I contact Nominet regarding re-tagging my now de-tagged domain.
  3. I fill out a form.
  4. I fax the form with proof of ID.
  5. I wait 5 days for them to do anything.
  6. Upon re-tagging, I contact a new domain management company to take care of my domain.
  7. I wait a day for them to change my nameservers.

The end!
