Recently, while working on my website I've become exposed to the [Behaviour JavaScript library](http://bennolan.com/behaviour/), which I may say is absolutely wonderful. Very simple and straight forward, completely removes the need for those cursed script tags appended to the bottom of a page; something which I’ve never liked doing but became a bit of a necessary burden! In short it allows you to execute arbitrary code on elements in the DOM using CSS selectors; so, for example, you can apply an `onclick` event only to elements which match `form fieldset div#items a.add`<sup>1</sup>, very handy indeed!

Outside of the web I got my hands on a copy of [Star Wars: Empire at War](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007A5FZS/qid=1141728007/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-0724979-2170829), which is easily the best Star Wars RTS game I’ve played (which isn’t hard). Very entertaining, if a little same-y after a while. Definitely worth playing though.

Even further outside of the web — in the real world — Sara and I got tickets for the Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age and Motörhead show in Hyde Park, London. That should be an entertaining night and it’s a very good excuse to get ourselfs down to London again, a city we really enjoyed last time.

<sup>1</sup> Any anchors with a class of "add", within a div with an ID of "items" that itself is within a fieldset in a form tag.
