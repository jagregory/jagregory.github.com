I don’t know what it is, but there seems to be an inherent urge of web developers (or designers, managers or whomever) to create forms that are hugely bloated and pointless, even for simple things such as sending a contact e-mail.

This fascination with bloated forms is incomprehensible to me, I just can’t understand why anybody would want to know the gender or official title of somebody who’s simply trying to say “Hello”; it’s irrelevant, all I personally care about is what they’ve got to say. Is it supposed to portray the company in an intelligent, professional manner? (<em>These people want my title, they obviously mean business!</em>) I don’t know, but it needs to stop.

I personally am a lot less inclined to fill out a form if it feels like an interrogation. Contact forms should consist of me entering my name, some form of contact information and my brain-dump - nothing else!

## Suggested form

I know which one I’d prefer.
