"Documentation? What documentation!" I hear you say. Yes, Fluent NHibernate is not best known for it's abundance of documentation. I know.

I've realised that over the past couple of months Fluent NHibernate has been growing in popularity, stupidly so. We've got new features out the bjingo, an active mailing list, and a flow of people moaning on twitter. Well I figure enough is enough, we need a proper website; googlecode is great for hosting, but it's wiki is poor, we needed something better.

**Announcing the official Fluent NHibernate website:** [http://fluentnhibernate.org](http://www.fluentnhibernate.org) and it's [wiki](https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki).

As always, comments are welcome on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate). Please, no porn on the wiki just yet.

I will be updating all my recent blog posts to point to the appropriate content on the wiki, and I would prefer if people would direct-link to the website rather than the googlecode project from now on. We'll still be using googlecode for hosting and issue tracking, but the wiki will be cleared out.

As with any wiki, the content is not final, and not exhaustive. I'm working on it.
