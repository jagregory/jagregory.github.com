<p>&#8220;Documentation? What documentation!&#8221; I hear you say. Yes, Fluent NHibernate is not best known for it&#8217;s abundance of documentation. I know.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve realised that over the past couple of months Fluent NHibernate has been growing in popularity, stupidly so. We&#8217;ve got new features out the bjingo, an active mailing list, and a flow of people moaning on twitter. Well I figure enough is enough, we need a proper website; googlecode is great for hosting, but it&#8217;s wiki is poor, we needed something better.</p>

<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Announcing the official Fluent NHibernate website:</strong> <a href='http://www.fluentnhibernate.org'>http://fluentnhibernate.org</a> and it&#8217;s <a href='https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki'>wiki</a>.</p>

<p>As always, comments are welcome on the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate'>mailing list</a>. Please, no porn on the wiki just yet.</p>

<p>I will be updating all my recent blog posts to point to the appropriate content on the wiki, and I would prefer if people would direct-link to the website rather than the googlecode project from now on. We&#8217;ll still be using googlecode for hosting and issue tracking, but the wiki will be cleared out.</p>

<p>As with any wiki, the content is not final, and not exhaustive. I'm working on it.</p>
