<p>It's <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you that don't know, <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> is for helping you map entities with <a href="http://nhforge.org">NHibernate</a>. It's based firmly on the practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">convention-over-configuration</a>, and can be used in a mapping-per-class style using our <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Fluent_mapping">fluent interface</a>, or let our <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Auto_mapping">automapper</a> map your entities itself.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>This release introduces a few significant changes, and a lot of insignificant ones. You should refer to the <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0">1.0 release notes</a> for an overview of what's changed.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org">wiki</a> has also been upgraded to use different software which should hopefully stop people being blocked, and make it a bit more stable; the upgrade included completely rewriting all of the pages, so don't anyone say that it's out of date.</p>

<p>You can get the binaries from the our <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads">downloads page</a>, or get the source from the <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate">github site</a>.</p>

<p>Special thanks go out to the Fluent NHibernate team, Paul Batum, Hudson Akridge, Andrew Stewart, and Stuart Childs. Each of them has put in time and effort above what was asked of them, and they've all felt guilty when not contributing, which is great. Thanks also to all the testers and contributors we've had over the months. Specifically Darko Conrad, for finding about 30 separate issues with the release candidiate; Everett Muniz and his subclasses, who now has a test of his own; and Kevin Dente, for deciding to moan about our method names only <em>after</em> months of work and a release candidate. I owe everyone beers if ever I'm in your area.</p>

<p>Fabio Maulo, Ayende, and the rest of the NHibernate team: Thanks for a great tool. NHibernate is a shining example of all that is good in open source in the .Net world.</p>

<p>...and with that, I'm going on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Sydney&daddr=Brisbane+to:Cairns&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&sll=-25.656382,152.880249&sspn=1.383954,1.851196&ie=UTF8&ll=-25.522615,152.358398&spn=22.065278,29.619141&z=5">holiday</a>.</p>
