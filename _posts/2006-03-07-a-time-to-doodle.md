After being inspired by Kevin Cornell at [Bearskinrug](http://www.bearskinrug.co.uk/) I finally decided to try a drawing tablet, one of those magical designer tools. I bought a [Trust 1200-V2 Wireless Scroll Tablet](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DCL6G/026-0724979-2170829?%5Fencoding=UTF8) from Amazon for a fairly reasonable Â£40, which was an absolute breeze to set up, windows picked it up without the need to install the drivers, which is always nice.

My main complaint with it is that I was unable to (logically) get the tablet to map to anything less than both of my monitors, which was rubbish because that meant the tablet was being stretched horizontally; so you couldn't trace anything without it becoming distorted. I say logically, because last thing yesterday I somehow managed it, so my tablet maps to my primary monitor and my mouse continues to work across both - it'll take me a bit of time to get used to swapping but it's definitely worth it. I will try and figure out how I managed to get it working, so I can at least make a note of it for next time.

Now all I need to do is learn how to draw... I'm currently at [Rory](http://neopoleon.com/)'s standard of drawing, which of course is amazing!
