Last monday (8th of Feb) I did an <a href="http://jagregory.com/writings/git-e-van/">E-VAN on Git</a>; an introductory talk on Git and DVCS, covering pretty much everything you need to know for day-to-day Git life. I think it went down well, certainly didn't <em>hear</em> anyone complaining.

The talk was recorded, so if you haven't already seen it then you can do so at your own leisure.

The video is up on the <a href="http://vimeo.com/user1286822">E-VAN's Vimeo account</a>, specifically <a href="http://vimeo.com/9324683" title="Git E-VAN recording">here</a>.
