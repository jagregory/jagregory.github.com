Last monday (8th of Feb) I did an [E-VAN on Git](/writings/git-e-van/); an introductory talk on Git and DVCS, covering pretty much everything you need to know for day-to-day Git life. I think it went down well, certainly didn't *hear* anyone complaining.

The talk was recorded, so if you haven't already seen it then you can do so at your own leisure.

The video is up on the [E-VAN's Vimeo account](http://vimeo.com/user1286822), specifically [here](http://vimeo.com/9324683).
