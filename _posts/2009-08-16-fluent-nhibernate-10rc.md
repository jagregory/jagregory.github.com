It's nearly here, at long last [Fluent NHibernate](http://fluentnhibernate.org) has nearly reached 1.0. Now starts the official public testing of our 1.0RC.

You can read the [release notes](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0) on the wiki for more information on what's changed. There have been a lot of small breaking changes in the fluent interface, mostly reducing it's verbosity, and a few larger changes elsewhere. Don't expect to download this and have it *just work*, because it won't; hopefully it shouldn't be too painful though.

My plan is that this is a very quick turnaround for a release candidate. It's already undergone some heavy testing from some respected volunteers, but I wanted to get it into the public eye for a week or so before release. Ideally the RTM release won't differ from this one at all, but we'll see.

You can find the binaries on our [downloads page](http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads), and it's now included in the binary build releases too.

Any questions should be directed to the [mailing-list](http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate), and issues onto our [issue list](http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/issues/list).
