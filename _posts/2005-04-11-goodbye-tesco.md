I'm outta there, finally free from the bounds of a supermarket job. I've been taken in by Evolution Interactive, a web/multimedia design company.

I'm now a 'New Media Developer', nicer than 'Checkout Assistant' if I do say so my self. It's very strange to be in a real job, doing something that I actually want to do (and like doing). This is going to take some getting used toâ€¦
