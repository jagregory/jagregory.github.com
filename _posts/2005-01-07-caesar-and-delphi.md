While bored yesterday I decided to have a go with programming in Delphi, something which I've been intending to do for quite some time now. Anyway, here is the result.

Download CaesarShift.zip 244kb *(this download is no longer available, sorry)*

It's a simple cryptography program based on the shifting letters (Caesar Shift) methods. Took me about two hours, not bad to say I've never programmed in Delphi before.

Delphi seems nice, I'm not too keen on the syntax of the language though. Its all rather too much like VB for my likings, messy and unstructured. Maybe that's just me though.
