Quick update on the [Boo plugin I mentioned previously](/writings/boo-visual-studio-plug-in-1-complete/). Jeff Olson announced the [BooLangStudio](http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio) project a couple of days after I announced mine, and we've decided to join forces. I've begun merging our codebases, and we're looking to get a release out in the not too distant future.

Our combined code-bases have now got syntax highlighting, intellisense, single file and project support. Not bad going.

We've now got a nice little team going as well, which is a big improvement from what was the one man band of my self. One of the contributors, [Torkel Ã–degaard](http://www.codinginstinct.com/2008/05/boo-in-visual-studio.html), has written a [nice overview](http://www.codinginstinct.com/2008/05/boo-in-visual-studio.html) of our progress and processes as-well.
