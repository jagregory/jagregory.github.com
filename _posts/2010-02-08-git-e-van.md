Just a reminder that tonight I'll be doing an <a href="http://europevan.blogspot.com/2010/01/next-european-van-on-08-february-2010.html">E-VAN on Git</a> tonight at 7pm GMT.

<!-- more -->

It's going to be a pretty basic talk on what Git is (and indirectly what DVCS is), and a demo on how to use most of the features you'll need daily. There might be some advanced talk at the end, depending on how well I time things.

If you've already used Git (successfully), then this talk won't really be for you; unless you just want to listen to me ramble for an hour and an half.

Looking forward to "seeing" you there. Now, I best finish reading that "Getting started with Git" book I've had lying around for months.
