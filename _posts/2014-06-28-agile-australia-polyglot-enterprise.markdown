A colleague and I recently spoke at Agile Australia. a medium-to-large IT conference in Australia that is at least a bit more interesting than it name suggests. This year their theme was disruption, the kind big stodgy enterprises who attend Agile conferences are facing all over Australia.

Our topic this year was Polyglot Enterprise, or "Using the Right Tool for the Job". We spoke to the idea that excessive standardisation can hinder your ability to innovate and respond to market changes. In other words, if you optimise for a particular path don't be surprised when it's hard to change direction.

The talk wasn't recorded, for some unknown reason, so here's the condensed version.

As organisations grow and change, so does their technology landscape. Platforms multiply, tools and technologies appear and grow organically. Before long, if you're not careful, the landscape becomes a swamp. An uncomfortable place full of weird creatures and funny smells. We see multiple programming languages in these organisations, but more significantly we see multiples of everything: Operating Systems, Monitoring tools, communciation channels, deployment approaches, operational behaviour, and more. Everything and anything is ripe for multiple approaches and solutions.

A common reaction to this situation is heavy standardisation. People identify the variations in their systems as a weakness. It's hard to know how systems are supposed to work, nevermind if they actually are. Projects are expensive to build and maintain, every platform has it's own set of skills and only a subset of your people have them, it's wasteful. If only we didn't have the variations, then our people could be fungible.

So here comes the standardisation train. Choo choo. All aboard. One technology to rule them all. We hope all your problems are nails, because all we have now is a sack of hammers.

Unsurprisingly, mass standardisation rarely works out well. The people you hire to be your fungible resources tend to be a bit shit, as this mode of operation tends to go hand-in-hand with cost saving exercises.
