We’ve been sending out a (rather successful) e-mail campaign for <a href="http://www.swiftleisure.co.uk">Swift</a> over the past few days, a good experience and definitely an eye opener. Something that amused me over the course of the project was the way people were using the “Recommend a Friend” feature of the e-mail.

If you’re presented by a form, which asks for your friends name, e-mail address and some form of comment from yourself, what would you put in the name field? Common sense says that you should put their full name in, as generally that’s what people want; not these people though! Over 50% of the recommendations were supplied with first names only or nicknames - the most wonderful being “MUM”; yes, block capitals too.

So we have a nice collection of recommendations along the lines of:
<ol>
	<li>George</li>
	<li>Sally</li>
	<li>Geoff</li>
	<li>liz</li>
	<li>MUM</li>
</ol>
How very helpful.

They’ll love the targeted e-mails they’re bound to receive too; “Dear MUM, we think…”.
