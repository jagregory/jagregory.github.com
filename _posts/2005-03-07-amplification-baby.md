Upon receiving payment for my month of work, I promptly bought a new Amplifier for my musification; rendering me skint.

Thats not the point though, the amp is hot! Line 6 Spider II 210, not the biggest they make but big enough for me. It weighs a bloody tonne! This thing comes laden with 12 pre-defined tones, 4 custom presets and all the knobs you know you couldn’t live without.

The 12 default tones range from your standard spangly Clean tone right the way up to some godforsaken guttural death metal style distortion, with everything in between. Each one of these tones can be tweaked to your hearts content via the knobs, if you make a tone that you are particularly fond of you can store it in one of the 4 custom presets. These can be accessed via the 4 buttons on the head, or via the footpedal that comes with it. If you pay an extra £100 you can get a FBV Shortboard pedal that enables you to save up to 36 (I think) presets, nice!

Built in tuner, noise-gate, tap-tempo for effects… Pretty good for £300.
Now I can sound like Hendrix, even if I can’t play like him. (Hey, its better than not being able to sound like him OR play like him!
