            <p>You’ve seen the title; it’s true.</p>

<p>I’ve been running an “administration” query to modify a table with around 190,000 records in. This table, segments, contains a status column called Coded. This value is derived from another table, faults. If any faults belonging to a segment has a coded status of 0 then the segment coded value is also 0.</p>

<p>My query did an update on each row in the segments table, retrieving a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> of how many faults there are with a coded status of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> that belong to the current segment. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> is greater than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> then the segment coded is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, otherwise to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>.</p>

<p>It ran for over 2 hours without any sign of finishing.</p>

<p>I changed the query to do a simple case statement with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exists</code> on the faults table where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Coded = 0</code> and it’s just finished in 4 minutes. Unbelievable.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>The web has come a long way in the past few years, but it is still hindered greatly by the methodology of the “previous generation” of web-designers. People are still designing with the mentality of serving everyone with a page that is specifically tailored to suit their particular browser and operating system. While this did get the job done originally, it was most certainly a lot more work than it needed to be. That’s why I find the idea of generating one (and only one) document to serve all users very interesting. Most browsers are conforming to standards in some way shape or form, the majority support CSS2 and XHTML 1.1 and the ones that don’t (mostly) degrade gracefully. It’s no longer about serving a page that is pixel perfect on every system; it’s about making sure all users get a good experience from your site.</p>

<p>Another branch of this takes the form of Accessibility. Accessibility has recently been highlighted by governments as a priority for websites; the US and UK both have their own take on the situation with relating laws and amendments. It basically boils down to any website that is providing a service should have a bare minimum of accessibility; otherwise they are discriminating against their less able customers. This means businesses are required, by law, to provide for all their customers (whether or not they have disabilities). Just as you would expect a shop to provide wheelchair ramps for disabled shoppers, you should expect pages to be designed to aid disabled web-users.</p>

<p>Recently I equipped my self with a screen-reader (<a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/software_jaws.asp">JAWS</a>) and was appalled — but not particularly shocked — at the amount of sites that are simply unusable with anything other than a standard browser. Most pages are so full of invalid markup that the screen-readers simply mumble on continuously and any actual content is undecipherable. If websites complied to the standards then their experience would be tolerable at the very least. Unfortunately the majority of website designers simply do not know (or often care) about creating accessible pages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Screen-readers, for those that don’t know, take a web page and read it out using a synthesised voice. A perfectly accessible site would read the same as a printed document.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the largest problems with the way pages have been designed in the past has been using the supplied tags for their appearance rather than their actual purpose. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;b&gt;</code> tags have been used to create bold headings, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;font&gt;</code> tags used to change styles of fonts and worst of all the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;table&gt;</code> tags for layout. This means when a screen reader parses these pages it emphasises the wrong words and spouts nonsense when encountering these convoluted tags. What a properly designed page would have is a distinct separation of content and layout, of HTML and CSS. The HTML document should use be structured like a standard plain text print document; with appropriate headings, sub-headings, lists and paragraphs. These tags can then be styled using CSS to any manner to which they like. So when a screen reader encounters this page it reads the unstyled version; a perfectly formed document.</p>

<p>That’s the end of my little rant, maybe together we learned something.</p>

            <p>In my previous post I talked about my exception logging system that I laid to rest. Fortunately for me that doesn’t mean my applications are logless, quite the contrary. I’ll explain…</p>

<p>When I came to terms with my logging system being inadequate and hard to maintain, I began looking for a replacement. To my delight I came across <a href="http://www.raboof.com/Projects/Elmah/Elmah.aspx">ELMAH</a>  written by <a href="http://www.raboof.com">Atif Aziz</a>. ELMAH is basically a couple of HttpModules and a HttpHandler that intercept any unhandled exceptions from within your application and log them. This is where the fun begins…</p>

            <p>Something I’ve always been tinkering with for my ASP.Net applications has been exception logging. I often get irritated when users (or applications) supply me with misleading or incorrect error messages, or at least incorrect directions of how to recreate the error.</p>

<p>I worked for quite some time trying to create a Logging system that would cater for my needs, and I got quite close to doing that. I created a small go-between object for the Trace and Debug logging and wrote that to my own XML file. The idea behind it, of course, was to make it easier for my self in debugging problems, if I could supply my self with all the data that I know I would require to trace an issue then, in theory, I could correct it much more quickly. This took me quite some time to create and of course was not perfect.</p>

  <p>Note from future James: There’s nothing practically useful here for you now, this has been long-since
made irrelevant; however, it is an interesting insight into what things used to be like! Kids these
days etc…</p>

  <p>Having a debugger for JavaScript wasn’t part of the browser itself yet, Firebug was the first good
example of this and but only came out the year of this post, and Chrome wasn’t a thing for another
4 years. Instead you had to connect Visual Studio to Internet Explorer, and debug JavaScript that way.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Visual Studio could debug Stored Procedures. I remember this being particularly painful
and involving copy-and-pasting DLLs into various directories in your system. I’m glad we don’t
work with Stored Procedures much anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Debugging is a great thing… Often though I’ve dreamt of some greater, more useful debugger. It would have helped if I’d actually gone out and looked for such a thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, I haven’t found a better debugger. I’ve found how to use the current one better! I’ve enabled client-side script debugging, which is fantastic. No more using IE or Firefoxes vague error messages, I can now step through code just as you would VB/C#.Net. The big one for me though has to be the ability to debug Stored Procedures, yes SQL Server Stored Procedures. Breakpoints, step-through, the lot.</p>
