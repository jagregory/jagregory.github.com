    <h1 class="title">Time, Time, Time</h1>
    <div class="entry"><p>Time is a funny thing, a day can drag out and feel like an eternity, but a year can pass in a blink of an eye.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m about 8,395 days old today, that&#8217;s roughly 201,480 rotations of the hour hand of your clock. Remember how long it takes for that hour hand to drip by while you&#8217;re in yet another boring meeting? I&#8217;ve had over 201 thousand of them.</p>

<p>That all equates to 23 years old, which isn&#8217;t too bad I suppose.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not often I talk about myself. I have a lot of opinions, but I generally keep me to myself. On this occasion I&#8217;m going to give myself a pat on the back.</p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;m pretty proud of myself.</strong></p>

<p>I have no qualifications, I have no A-levels, and only a few GCSEs. I am completely self-taught.</p>

<p>One thing that I&#8217;ve learnt is that only you know yourself. If somebody says you can&#8217;t do something, fuck them. Who are they to tell you what you can and can&#8217;t do? Prove them wrong.</p>

<p>I was told that programming is hard, and it&#8217;s not something you can learn in your bedroom any more. I was told I&#8217;d not be earning more than £14,000 by the time I was 20. I was told there was no chance I could get a job without any formal qualifications. Two jobs down the line, too many languages to list, and more money than sense - I think I proved them all wrong.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do for yourself is to learn how to learn. It&#8217;s the one thing they don&#8217;t teach you in school. Since I learnt how to learn, I&#8217;ve gained so much knowledge.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t concern yourself with the details, learn the techniques, learn the principals. It can be mistaken for arrogance, but I&#8217;m so confident in my ability to <em>learn</em>, that I can safely say that I can use <strong>any programming language</strong>, any operating system, any technology, ever invented and ever to be invented.</p>

<p>I am not scared of change, of new technologies, and I&#8217;m not afraid of being left behind. I can adapt, because I can learn.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a crazy ride so far, I look forward to what the next few years bring.</p>
