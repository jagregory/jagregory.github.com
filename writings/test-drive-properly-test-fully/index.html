            <p>I started writing this as a comment, but I felt it’s own post was deserved.</p>

<p><a href="http://rickyclarkson.blogspot.com/">Ricky Clarkson</a> left me a link in a comment to one of <a href="http://rickyclarkson.blogspot.com/2007/05/you-dont-need-tdd-you-need-repl.html">his posts</a> that ties in quite nicely to my recent <a href="http://blog.jagregory.com/2007/07/17/getting-with-it-test-driven-development/">Getting with it: Test Driven Development</a> post.</p>

<p>Ricky makes the point that TDD can be dangerous, and can lull you into a false sense of security. <em>I agree.</em></p>

<p>As with any technology, when used incorrectly it can cause more damage than not using it at all.</p>

<p>Ricky’s example should serve as a double-barreled warning. You can’t be test-driven only when it’s convenient, and you need to have good test coverage.</p>

<h2 id="being-test-driven-isnt-being-convenience-driven">Being Test-Driven isn’t being Convenience-Driven</h2>

<p>Just by being in a car with seat-belts doesn’t mean they’ll save you when you crash, you need to actually wear them.</p>

<p>You can’t pick and choose which parts of TDD you want to use, then be surprised when it lets you down.</p>

<p>If your boss comes storming in demanding a copy of the system, tell him to wait. Remember, it’s your hide on the line, if you give him a broken system you’ll be the one to pay. If he doesn’t understand testing, lie, tell him it’s building or something similar, it doesn’t exist until it’s finished.</p>

<h2 id="test-coverage">Test coverage</h2>

<p>There’s very little more important than good test coverage, without it you’re leaving yourself wide open for problems.</p>

<p>In Ricky’s example, he’s fallen into a common problem with test design. <em>He’s only testing the expected outcome of his method.</em> We’ve all fallen into this trap at some point, but it’s a dangerous place to be. Without full coverage, just as Ricky said, you end up with a false sense of security.</p>

<p>For full test coverage of a method, you really need to test it’s expected outcome, how it handles edge-cases, and how it handles bad data.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">assert</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">equal</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">point+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">point</span> <span class="mi">999</span> <span class="mi">987</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">point</span> <span class="mi">789</span> <span class="mi">998</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">point</span> <span class="mi">1788</span> <span class="mi">1985</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Had Ricky’s test suite included the above edge-case test, it would have caught the flaw in his method’s design, and been able to correct it. A few more like the above, to cover minus numbers and very low values, and his situation would have been greatly different.</p>

<p>If there’s a way you can improve testing, it’s to write more unit tests. Only leave those bits you really can’t test to integration. Everything else should be adequately covered.</p>

<h2 id="in-parting">In parting</h2>

<p>Remember, using TDD isn’t an excuse to leave your common sense at the door. If you’re writing a method which you know is going to be used in several places, test those several places, give it very good coverage. If you’re writing a sum function like Ricky, you know how it’s going to be used, don’t just write if statements to cover all your input data, that’s using coding to make a test pass an excuse to write bad code.</p>
