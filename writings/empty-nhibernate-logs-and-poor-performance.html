            <p>We had an issue recently where NHibernate was performing very poorly on our production server, but not on our developer machines or our test server. I investigated the issue and narrowed it down to two symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Symptom 1:</strong> Very poor performance. I’m talking 10+ seconds per page load, with no more than 5 queries being executed by NHibernate.</p>

<p><strong>Symptom 2:</strong> Empty log files. None of our log files had any data in on the live server, but they did on our other systems.</p>

<p>I decided to investigate the second symptom first, as it may be causing the first (ends up it was).</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Firstly, I noticed that our logging was set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code>. Must’ve been a leftover from when we first deployed NHibernate, very sloppy, I know. So I reset that to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WARN</code>, but it had no effect.</p>

<p>When files aren’t being written to, you should always check the directory permissions. Low and behold, it was a permissions problem. Our test server had different users allowed to write to the Logs directory than our production server. I granted the same users access, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NETWORK SERVICE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IUSR_MACHINENAME</code> in our case.</p>

<p>After I recycled the IIS worker processes, we were flying again. We’re back to having &lt; 1sec page loads.</p>

<p>This is pure speculation, but what I believe was happening is this: Logging was set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code>, so it was logging <em>a lot</em>. With each log call, the logger was failing to get write access to the files and throwing an exception, that exception would probably have propagated a bit too. The combination of the sheer amount of data being written to the log, and an exception per log call, were responsible for the severe slowdown.</p>

<p>So in short: Always make sure NHibernate has write access to its own log directory!</p>
