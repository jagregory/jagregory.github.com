            <p>The weekend just past was my first that I’ve had to work since I left Tesco. Not an entirely unpleasant experience, although I would have much rather had my weekend.</p>

<p>The reason we had to work the weekend was down to us launching (re-launching actually) a product for a customer’s extranet, something that a lot of people had been rather worried about. Mainly because, apparently, the previous time this product was launched it corrupted important data for six months without anyone noticing. Wonderful.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Something I wasn’t too happy about when I first inherited this project is that it was my sole responsibility. Slowly I came around to the idea though, it would be all my fault if everything went wrong, true, but it’d also be all down to me if everything went well; looks pretty good being responsible for a whole project only 10 months into a job.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is now day 1 of the launch at an end and a few niggling things aside, everything went swimmingly. No show stopping bugs at all, only minor things that took barely more than a minute to fix. I can safely say I’m in the good books.</p>

<p>Here’s to day 2 going as well as day 1.</p>
