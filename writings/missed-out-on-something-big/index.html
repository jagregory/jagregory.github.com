    <h1 class="title">Missed Out on Something Big</h1>
    <div class="entry"><p>Ever get the feeling that you&#8217;ve missed out on something big? I never got to see Star Wars at the cinema. I missed out on the start of computers, the ASM, the BASIC hacking and what-not. I discovered most of my musical taste way after the bands were gone or going, so I never got to see them in show.</p>

<p>None of those are my fault, of course, because they were all before my time; in fact, most were at least a decade before me. That still doesn&#8217;t stop me from ocasionally getting the feeling that I missed out on something big.</p>

<p>One more. One that&#8217;s pertient to our industry: Smalltalk.</p>

<p>Smalltalk is one of those languages, possibly the most prominent example, that has been idolised over time. It&#8217;s often touted as having an excellent programmer experience, properly object-oriented, the source of refactoring, great tools, and a solid virtual machine behind it. It&#8217;s one of those languages that people are proud to say they once worked with it. A language that people nosalgicly look back on. It&#8217;s also got an air of betamax about it (yeah, I missed that one too), people were sure it was better, but it still didn&#8217;t become mainstream.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We Smalltalkers used to think the advantages of our language were so significant that it would take over the world. We had a huge productivity advantage over C coders. Then C++ came along and gave C coders just enough to let them improve their productivity and their ability to write larger more complex systems. It still wasnâ€™t as good as Smalltalk, but it was better than C, and much more accessible to most programmers than Smalltalk.&#8221; - <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/5/31/quick-railsconf-update">Josh Susser</a> via <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/06/bit-of-history-and-interesting.html">Raganwald</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So where am I going with this? Just like I can make myself feel a bit better by watching Star Wars on a large TV, or listening to the Rolling Stones live albums. I&#8217;d like to see what all the fuss was about with Smalltalk, by giving it a go.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure where to start on this, or how long it&#8217;s going to take, or even when I&#8217;m going to do it; however, one day in the not too distant future I&#8217;m going to do some programming with Smalltalk.</p>
