            <blockquote><p>Cross-posted to <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jagregory/archive/2009/07/20/git-s-and-command-line-fear.aspx">Los Techies</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a> has been gaining a lot of traction lately, and rightly so. I've used it for a couple of years now, for all my projects (<a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> and <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com">Docu</a> being the prominent ones), but something that hasn't changed is the tag-line of "but Windows support isn't very good!". What you quickly learn is that when people say that, they actually mean there isn't a Visual Studio plug-in or some similar all-singing all-dancing GUI; this is a dire misrepresentation of Git, because it's tooling on Windows is excellent if your definition of tooling includes the command-line.</p>

<p>It's something ingrained in Windows developers, they hate the command-line. There's a very good chance that if you encounter a Windows developer that does enjoy using the command-line it's because they've also worked on another platform or in another environment that encourages command-line use (Rails is a good example). I've tried various ways of encouraging people to experiment, but very few work without being able to sit down and just show them something. It's very much like R# adoption, nobody thinks it'll speed them up until they see how fast someone else can be.</p>

<p>Back onto Git. If you don't like what Git does, then that's fine, but don't label yourself as Alt.Net or a continuous improver if this sounds like you: "I define myself by choosing the best tool for each situation, but there's no way you'll get me using the command-line." Way to go, oh open-minded one. Try it, you might like it.</p>

<p>The other techies have been posting some great <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/tags/git/default.aspx">Git posts</a> which can help you get up to speed. I hope to contribute, with less bile, soon.</p>
