<p>Lets get some learning done. There are a few questions that keep cropping up when I introduce people to Git, so I thought I&#8217;d post some answers as a mini-series of blog posts. I&#8217;ll cover some fundamentals, while trying not to retread too much ground that the fantastic <a href="http://book.git-scm.com">Git community book</a> already covers so well. Instead I&#8217;m going to talk about things that should help you understand what you and Git are doing day-to-day.</p>




<h3>What&#8217;s a branch?</h3>




<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking. <em>&#8220;C&#8217;mon, we know what a branch is&#8221;</em>. A branch is a copy of a source tree, that&#8217;s maintained separately from it&#8217;s parent; that&#8217;s what we perceive a branch to be, and that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re used to dealing with them. Sometimes they&#8217;re physical copies (VSS and TFS), other times they&#8217;re lightweight copies (SVN), but they&#8217;re copies non-the-less. Or are they?</p>




<p>Lets look at it a different way. <em>The Git way</em>.</p>




<p>Git works a little differently than most other version control systems. It doesn&#8217;t store changes using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding">delta encoding</a>, where complete files are built up by stacking differences contained in each commit. Instead, in Git each commit stores a snapshot of how the repository looked when the commit occurred; a commit also contains a bit of meta-data, author, date, but more importantly a reference to the parent of the commit (the previous commit, usually).</p>




<p>That&#8217;s a bit weird, I know, but bare with me.</p>




<p>So what is a branch? Nothing more than a pointer to a commit (with a name). There&#8217;s nothing physical about it, nothing is created, moved, copied, nothing. A branch contains no history, and has no idea of what it consists of beyond the reference to a single commit.</p>




<p>Given a stack of commits:</p>


<p><img src="/images/GitGuts1_Figure1.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p>The branch references the newest commit. If you were to make another commit in this branch, the branch&#8217;s reference would be updated to point at the new commit.</p>


<p><img src="/images/GitGuts2_Figure2.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p>The history is built up by recursing over the commits through each&#8217;s parent.</p>




<h3>What&#8217;s HEAD?</h3>




<p>Now that you know what a branch is, this one is easy. <code>HEAD</code> is a reference to the latest commit in the branch you&#8217;re in.</p>




<p>Given these two branches:</p>


<p><img src="/images/GitGuts1_Figure3.png" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p>If you had master checked out, <code>HEAD</code> would reference <code>e34fa33</code>, the exact same commit that the master branch itself references. If you had feature checked out, <code>HEAD</code> would reference <code>dde3e1</code>. With that in mind, as both <code>HEAD</code> and a branch is just a reference to a commit, it is sometimes said that <code>HEAD</code> points to the current branch you&#8217;re on; while this is not strictly true, in most circumstances it&#8217;s close enough.</p>




<h3>What&#8217;s a fast-forward?</h3>




<p>A fast-forward is what Git does when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead the one you have checked-out.</p>




<p>Given the following branch setup:</p>


<p><img src="/images/GitGuts1_Figure4.png" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p>You&#8217;ve got both branches referencing the same commit. They&#8217;ve both got exactly the same history. Now commit something to feature.</p>


<p><img src="/images/GitGuts1_Figure5.png" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<p>The <code>master</code> branch is still referencing <code>7ddac6c</code>, while <code>feature</code> has advanced by two commits. The <code>feature</code> branch can now be considered ahead of <code>master</code>.</p>




<p>It&#8217;s now quite easy to see what&#8217;ll happen when Git does a fast-forward. It simply updates the <code>master</code> branch to reference the same commit that <code>feature</code> does. No changes are made to the repository itself, as the commits from <code>feature</code> already contain all the necessary changes.</p>




<p>Your repository history would now look like this:</p>


<p><img src="/images/GitGuts1_Figure6.png" alt="Figure 6" /></p>

<h3>When doesn&#8217;t a fast-forward happen?</h3>




<p>Fast-forwards don&#8217;t happen in situations where changes have been made in the original branch and the new branch.</p>


<p><img src="/images/GitGuts1_Figure7.png" alt="Figure 7" /></p>

<p>If you were to merge or rebase <code>feature</code> onto <code>master</code>, Git would be unable to do a fast-forward because the trees have both diverged. Considering Git commits are immutable, there&#8217;s no way for Git to get the commits from <code>feature</code> into <code>master</code> without changing their parent references.</p>




<p>For more info on all this object malarky, I&#8217;d recommend reading the <a href="http://book.git-scm.com">Git community book</a>.</p>
