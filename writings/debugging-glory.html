  <p>Note from future James: There’s nothing practically useful here for you now, this has been long-since
made irrelevant; however, it is an interesting insight into what things used to be like! Kids these
days etc…</p>

  <p>Having a debugger for JavaScript wasn’t part of the browser itself yet, Firebug was the first good
example of this and but only came out the year of this post, and Chrome wasn’t a thing for another
4 years. Instead you had to connect Visual Studio to Internet Explorer, and debug JavaScript that way.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Visual Studio could debug Stored Procedures. I remember this being particularly painful
and involving copy-and-pasting DLLs into various directories in your system. I’m glad we don’t
work with Stored Procedures much anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Debugging is a great thing… Often though I’ve dreamt of some greater, more useful debugger. It would have helped if I’d actually gone out and looked for such a thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, I haven’t found a better debugger. I’ve found how to use the current one better! I’ve enabled client-side script debugging, which is fantastic. No more using IE or Firefoxes vague error messages, I can now step through code just as you would VB/C#.Net. The big one for me though has to be the ability to debug Stored Procedures, yes SQL Server Stored Procedures. Breakpoints, step-through, the lot.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Client-side debugging is so obvious I was kicking my self when I got it working. All you need to do is go into Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced and check the Enable Client-Side Debugging” in Internet explorer. You may need to do some jiggery-pokery in VS but I can’t remember what.</p>

<p>SqlServer is a bit more complicated, you need to copy the mssdi98.dll from your [visual studio installation]\sqlserver folder into your sqlserver instances binn folder. Then open up Enterprise Manager and grant Exec permissions to the user you use to log-in (or the Builtin\Administrators group) for the extended procedure sp_sdidebug. Lastly in your project options in VS mark the Enable Sql Debugging. That should be it, from the server explorer in VS you should now be able to choose step-into” from any stored procedure, function or trigger!</p>

<p>Productivity++</p>
