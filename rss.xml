      <title>My ever evolving development virtualisation situation</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/virtualised-development-environments</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I’ve moved closer and closer to virtualising my entire development environment. It started with developing for Windows whilst using a Mac, continued when I refused to sully my machine with some godforsaken Oracle product, and has now reached completion with the arrival of a new laptop and an unwillingness to install RVM again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Converting and preserving Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/converting-and-preserving-michael-abrash-graphics-programming-black-book</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; The Markdown source of Michael Abrash’s Graphics Programming Black Book is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/abrash-black-book&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;, there are Epub and Mobi versions on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/abrash-black-book/releases&quot;&gt;Github Releases list&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read an online copy of the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book/&quot;&gt;on my website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out as an attempt to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Abrash&quot;&gt;Michael Abrash’s&lt;/a&gt; Graphics Programming Black Book over the Christmas period. It turned into a epic mission of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt;, and a few blisters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go Slice Visualiser</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/go-slice-visualiser</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been learning &lt;a href=&quot;http://golang.org&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; recently; it’s been fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting aspect of Go is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals&quot;&gt;Slices&lt;/a&gt;, which are lightweight views of an array. Why these are useful and necessary makes more sense when you understand Go’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://golang.org/doc/faq#pass_by_value&quot;&gt;pass-by-value&lt;/a&gt; semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst playing with slices, I put together a little visualiser to help understand their behaviour (the act of building it was probably more useful than the end result).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re sorry, but something went wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been seeing some strange behaviour on the development environment for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getonthegame.com.au&quot;&gt;On the Game&lt;/a&gt; recently. I’ve just spent an hour combing through every line of code that varies from a standard Rails app, and I’ve finally found the issue. I’m putting it here for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have enough free time to learn a new language!”, or tool, or framework, etc. I hear this often. I appreciate we all handle things differently, but here’s my take on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NDC 2010</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/ndc-2010</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndc2010.no&quot;&gt;NDC 2010&lt;/a&gt; was a huge success, if you ask me. This was largely down to the NDC team, who deserve all the praise they’re getting (and much more). Unlike conferences I’ve been to in the past, NDC was truely by the people, for the people. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.scottbellware.com&quot;&gt;Scott Bellware&lt;/a&gt; put it much better than I could, with his &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/06/praise-for-norwegian-developers.html&quot;&gt;praise for Norwegian Developers&lt;/a&gt; (and Kjersti Sandberg). Herself and the rest of the team were there because they wanted to be, not because they had to. The whole attitude surrounding this conference was one of learning, not plugging products or motives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go into great detail about the individual aspects of the conference, but it’s much easier to say that there’s nothing I’d change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one conference you should go to next year, make it NDC 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My part in all this...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented on two topics at NDC; the first was an introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;, and the second an introduction and demo of &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;. Fluent NHibernate was on the Thursday, and Git the Friday. It was a great experience speaking at an event of this size, and the number of people who seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say (by either turning up to my talks, or approaching me afterwards) was quite humbling. If you’re interested in seeing what I presented, the talks will be on the NDC website before too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The videos are becoming available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://streaming.ndc2010.no&quot;&gt;streaming.ndc2010.no&lt;/a&gt;, but they're suffering from bandwidth issues. If you do want to watch the videos, please stream them until the issues are resolved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to me speaking, and also being woefully unprepared, I didn’t get to see as many talks as I would’ve liked — regardless of how well rehearsed and prepared my talks are, it seems I always end up rewriting them an hour before I go on — I did end up catching Lisa Crispin, Steve Strong, Eric Evans, Greg Young, Jon Skeet, Roy Osherove, Michael Feathers, Sebastian Lambla, and Mark Nijhof. I recommend you catch their talks online when they’re published. The quality of the talks at NDC have been significantly higher than I’ve seen elsewhere, and (more importantly) the technical level seems to be higher too; there was very few basic talks (a few introductions, mine included, but no pandering), but the majority were pretty in-depth. This is quite a contrast to the all-too-often “Microsoft technology of the week” presentations you can get at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a big part of any conference is what happens between (and after) the talks. Meeting other developers is a big part of why I go to these things, after all I don’t get out much normally. The socialising aspect of NDC was excellent, good drinks and food was had by all (I have a good idea they did anyway, at least one place we ate refused to serve us as a group anything other than the same meal for everyone!). I can’t possibly list everyone who I met while I was out there, but it was really good to meet up with some people who I’ve known on Twitter for a long time; specifically Hadi Hariri, Steve Strong, Greg Young, Ben Hall, Seb Lambla, Mark Nijhof, and Rob Conery are ones that stand out to me right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NDC 2011 will be next year, and it’s looking like it’ll be in May this time. If there’s anyone that’s on the fence about going, I would whole heartedly recommend you do. Even more so, I’d recommend you submit a talk of your own. It’s a great way to test yourself, if nothing else. I’ll definitely be going next year; hopefully I’ll speak again, but if not I’ll still be there. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Speaking engagements in 2010</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/speaking-engagements-2010</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to get out of my shell more this year, I’ve taken up speaking (at conferences, not just in general). First came my &lt;a href=&quot;http://jagregory.com/writings/git-e-van-recording/&quot;&gt;Git E-VAN&lt;/a&gt;, then came &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiesta.lostechies.com/&quot;&gt;Pablo’s Fiesta&lt;/a&gt;, so what else have I got lined up this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://codingday.org/&quot;&gt;Irish Open Spaces Coding Day II&lt;/a&gt; in Dublin, where I’ll be speaking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ndc2010.no&quot; title=&quot;Norwegian Developers Conference 2010&quot;&gt;NDC 2010&lt;/a&gt; in Oslo, speaking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; and DVCS with Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstracts for my talks can be found below. If you’re interested in hearing me speak, or know of any opportunities that you think I might be interested in, please drop me an email (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:james@jagregory.com&quot;&gt;james@jagregory.com&lt;/a&gt;). You can see my availability on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mtbk7g2u13e2j7s1u8p0flitho@group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=Europe/London&amp;amp;gsessionid=GBDJzqgaRWqAze87fNda9Q&quot;&gt;speaking calendar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An introduction and overview to object⁄relational mapping using Fluent NHibernate. See how Fluent NHibernate can help you map your domain with the least amount of effort, how you can remain flexible with your database, and how to drive your design through convention–over–configuration; all without writing a single line of XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk is an introduction to Fluent NHibernate for those that aren’t familiar with it, and assumes some NHibernate experience and is for .Net developers primarily. The goal is to show people how low–impact NHibernate can be with Fluent NHibernate, and how it can actually speed up development in rapid–change environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll cover an overview of what Fluent NHibernate is, the various parts of it (the fluent interface, the conventions, and the auto–mappings, and the configuration aspect), then expand on how these features can be utilised to improve your NHibernate experience and simplify your development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction to Git&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An introduction to distributed version control using Git, and how your VCS should work with you and not against you. How DVCS can completely alter your development process, streamline it, and help you produce better software, faster. Covering how local repositories speed up your development, multiple authoritative sources, distributed teams, multiple workflows, and some of the more distinct features of Git. With experiences from an OSS team on how the migration from SVN to Git has helped the project and changed how the team works (Fluent NHibernate).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git E-VAN recording</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/git-e-van-recording</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last monday (8th of Feb) I did an &lt;a href=&quot;http://jagregory.com/writings/git-e-van/&quot;&gt;E-VAN on Git&lt;/a&gt;; an introductory talk on Git and DVCS, covering pretty much everything you need to know for day-to-day Git life. I think it went down well, certainly didn’t &lt;em&gt;hear&lt;/em&gt; anyone complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was recorded, so if you haven’t already seen it then you can do so at your own leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video is up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user1286822&quot;&gt;E-VAN’s Vimeo account&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/9324683&quot; title=&quot;Git E-VAN recording&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git E-VAN</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/git-e-van</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a reminder that tonight I’ll be doing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://europevan.blogspot.com/2010/01/next-european-van-on-08-february-2010.html&quot;&gt;E-VAN on Git&lt;/a&gt; tonight at 7pm GMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be a pretty basic talk on what Git is (and indirectly what DVCS is), and a demo on how to use most of the features you’ll need daily. There might be some advanced talk at the end, depending on how well I time things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already used Git (successfully), then this talk won’t really be for you; unless you just want to listen to me ramble for an hour and an half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to “seeing” you there. Now, I best finish reading that “Getting started with Git” book I’ve had lying around for months.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git: Remotes, contributions, and the letter N</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/git-remotes-contributions-and-the-letter-n</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few ways to think about Git and it’s distributed nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You deal with multiples of repositories, not a single central repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates come from a remote repository, and changes are pushed to a remote; none of these repositories have to be the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt; is the canonical name for the repository you cloned from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upstream&lt;/em&gt; is the canonical name for the original project repository you forked from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;General pushing and pulling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/remote-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing your changes to a remote: &lt;code&gt;git push remote_name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/remote-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling changes from a remote: &lt;code&gt;git pull remote_name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to rebase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;git fetch remote_name
git rebase remote_name/branch&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can change your &lt;code&gt;branch.autosetuprebase&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, to make this the default &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; behaviour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all there is to moving commits around in Git repositories. Any other operations you perform are all combinations of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Github &amp;mdash; personal repositories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re dealing directly with Github, on a personal project or as the project owner, your repositories will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/remote-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To push and pull changes between your local and your github repositories, just issue the push and pull commands with the origin remote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;git push origin
git pull origin&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set the defaults for these commands too, so the origin isn’t even necessary in a lot of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Github &amp;mdash; receiving contributions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a project owner, you’ll sometimes have to deal with contributions from other people. Each contributor will have their own github repository, and they’ll issue you with a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/remote-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no direct link to push between these two repositories; they’re unmanned. To manage changes from contributors, you need to involve your local repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of this as taking the shape of a V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/remote-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to register their github repository as a remote on your local, pull in their changes, merge them, and push them up to your github. This can be done as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote add contributor contributor_repository.git
git pull contributor branch
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Github &amp;mdash; providing contributions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do exactly as you would your own personal project. Local changes, pushed up to your github fork; then issue a pull request. That’s all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Github &amp;mdash; the big picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to imagine the whole process, think of it as an N shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/remote-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left is the contributor, and the right is the project. Flow goes from bottom left, along the lines to the top right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributor makes a commit in their local repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributor pushes that commit to their github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributor issues a pull request to the project
&lt;li&gt;Project lead pulls the contributor's change into their local repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project lead pushes the change up to the project github&lt;/li&gt;


That's as complicated as it gets.


&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Behaviours in MSpec</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/behaviours-in-mspec</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/machine/machine.specifications&quot;&gt;MSpec&lt;/a&gt; is awesome, I think it's praised by myself and others enough for that particular point to not need any expansion; however, there is a particular feature I would like to highlight that hasn't really got a lot of press: behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behaviours define reusable specs that encapsulate a particular set of, you guessed it, behaviours; you're then able to include these specs in any context that exhibits a particular behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets go with the cliche'd Vehicle example. Given an &lt;code&gt;IVehicle&lt;/code&gt; interface, with &lt;code&gt;Car&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Motorbike&lt;/code&gt; implementations; these all expose a &lt;code&gt;StartEngine&lt;/code&gt; method and some properties reflecting the state of the vehicle. We'll start the engine and verify that it is actually started, whether it's got anything on the rev counter, and whether it's killing our planet in the process (zing!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IVehicle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StartEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsEngineRunning&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsPolluting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RevCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IVehicle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsEngineRunning&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StartEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// use your imagination...
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Motorbike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IVehicle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsEngineRunning&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StartEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// use your imagination...
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are our classes, if rather contrived, but they'll do. Now what we need to do is write some specs for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;when_a_car_is_started&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Establish&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StartEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_have_a_running_engine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsEngineRunning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_be_polluting_the_atmosphere&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsPolluting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_be_idling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RevCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeBetween&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;when_a_motorbike_is_started&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Establish&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Motorbike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StartEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_have_a_running_engine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsEngineRunning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_have_a_running_engine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsEngineRunning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_be_polluting_the_atmosphere&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsPolluting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_be_idling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RevCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeBetween&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Motorbike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are our specs, there's not much in there but already you can see that we've got duplication. Our two contexts contain identical specs, they're the same in what they're verifying, the only difference is the vehicle instance. This is where behaviours can come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With behaviours we can extract the specs and make them reusable. Lets do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a class for your behaviour and adorn it with the &lt;code&gt;Behaviors&lt;/code&gt; attribute &amp;mdash; this ensures MSpec recognises your class as a behaviour definition and not just any old class &amp;mdash; then move your specs into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Behaviors]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;VehicleThatHasBeenStartedBehaviors&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IVehicle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_have_a_running_engine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsEngineRunning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_have_a_running_engine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsEngineRunning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_be_polluting_the_atmosphere&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsPolluting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;should_be_idling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RevCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ShouldBeBetween&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've now got our specs in the behaviour, and have defined a field for the vehicle instance itself (it won't compile otherwise). This is our behaviour complete, it defines a set of specifications that verify that a particular behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets hook that behaviour into our contexts from before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;when_a_car_is_started&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Establish&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StartEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Behaves_like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;VehicleThatHasBeenStartedBehaviors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a_started_vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;when_a_motorbike_is_started&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Establish&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Motorbike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StartEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Behaves_like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;VehicleThatHasBeenStartedBehaviors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a_started_vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Motorbike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've now put to use the &lt;code&gt;Behaves_like&lt;/code&gt; feature, which references our behaviour class and imports the specs into the current context. Now when you run your specs, the specs from our behaviour are imported and run in each context. We don't need to assign anything to that field, just defining it is enough; the name you choose for the field is what's used by MSpec as the description for what your class is behaving like. In our case this is translated roughly to &lt;em&gt;&quot;when a motorbike is started it behaves like a started vehicle&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things you need to be aware of to get this to work: your fields must be &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt;, both in the behaviour and the contexts; and the fields must have identical names. If you don't get these two correct your behaviour won't be hooked up properly. It's also good to know that the fields &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; need to have the same type, as long as the value from your context is assignable to the field in the behaviour then you're good; this is key to defining reusable specs for classes that share a sub-set of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, behaviours are an excellent way of creating reusable specs for shared functionality, without the need to create complex inheritance structures. It's not a feature you should use lightly, as it can greatly reduce the readability of your specs, but it is a good feature if you've got a budding spec explosion nightmare on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git's guts: Merging and rebasing</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/gits-guts-merging-and-rebasing</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Cross posted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jagregory/archive/2009/11/27/git-guts-merging-and-rebasing.aspx&quot;&gt;Los Techies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go again, explaining the internals of Git with the intention of helping you understand what you're doing day-to-day. Last time I covered &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/gits-guts-branches-head-and-fast-forwards&quot;&gt;branches, HEAD, and fast-forwarding&lt;/a&gt;. Today we'll dive into the guts of merging and rebasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Merging branches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've probably merged before. You do it when you want the changes from one branch in another. The principal is the same in Git as it is most other source control systems, but the implementation differs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the following commit structure, consisting of two branches created from the same commit, each with two commits after the branching occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these two branches are merged together, this is the structure that results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top-most commit, the red one, is a new commit made by the merge; the merge commit is what reminds Git that a merge occurred next time it's showing the history. This commit is special, as it contains multiple parent's in it's meta-data; these multiple parent's allow Git to follow the two trees of commits that constituted the branches that were merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One difference in how Git handles merges compared to many other SCMs is that it preserves the commits that were made in both branches. In other systems merges are often represented as a single commit containing the squashed contents of all the commits that were made in the branch being merged in. Git doesn't do this (by default, you can tell it to if you want), and therefore preserves all the commits just as they were made; this is quite nice, as it proves incredibly useful to be able to track the origin of changes beyond the point of a merge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you merge two branches, it's interesting to know that none of the commits are altered in the process. Just bare this in mind for now, I'll explain why this is good to know later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a merge, if you were to view the history, you'd see it shown like the previous example, commits in chronological order; the feature branch commits are interspersed between the master commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet no commits have been altered in the merge, so how are the commits in a different order? Well, they're not, Git's just showing you it in the order you expect it to be in. Internally the structure is still as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merge commit instructs Git to walk the two trees while building the history, and it just displays the results in chronological order. This makes more sense if you recall that Git commits don't hold differences like other SCM systems, instead they each contain a snapshot of the complete repository; while in another SCM the ordering of commits is vital &amp;mdash; otherwise the diffs wouldn't build a valid file &amp;mdash; Git is able to infer order without affecting the repository contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at it in commit order, you can quite easily see how Git flattens the history to be perceived as linear without ever having to touch any of the original commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What happens if there's a merge conflict?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've all dealt with conflicts in merging before. They typically happen when changes are made to the same file in two branches, in a way that cannot be easily merged (two people edit the same line, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git's commit's are immutable though, so how are the changes that you need to make to resolve these conflicts saved? Simple. The merge commit is a regular commit with some extra meta-data, and so it capable of containing changes itself; merge conflict changes are stored in the merge commit. Again, no changes necessary to the original commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Git objects, immutability, and rewriting history&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Git repository is comprised of objects. A file is a blob object with a name attached to it; if you have two files with the same content, that's just two names to a single blob. A directory is a tree object, which is comprised of other trees and blobs. A commit is an object that references a tree object, which is the state of the repository at the time of committing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To read more about git objects, I'd definitely recommend you read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://book.git-scm.com&quot;&gt;Git community book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git objects are immutable. To change an object after it's been created is impossible, you have to recreate the object with any changes made. Even operations that seem to modify objects actually don't; &lt;code&gt;commit --amend&lt;/code&gt; is a typical example, that deletes and re-creates the commit rather than actually amending it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that merges don't rewrite history, and that it's a good thing. Now I'll explain why. When you rewrite history, you do so by making changes to commits that ripple up the commit tree; when this happens, it can cause complications when others merge from you. Given a series of commits, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then share these commits with another user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John now has Michael's commits in his repository; however, Michael notices he's made a typo in the first commit message, so he amends the commit message. The change in the message requires the commit be recreated. With that first commit recreated, the second commit now has an invalid parent reference, so that commit has to be recreated with the new reference; this recreation ripples it's way up the tree, recreating each commit with a new parent. Michael has completely rewritten his tree's history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice all the commit hashes have changed in Michael's repository, and John's now don't match. If Michael was then to make a new commit to his repository, and John tried to merge that change into his repository, Git would get very upset because the new commit would reference a commit that doesn't exist in John's repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The golden rule is:&lt;/strong&gt; rewriting history is fine as long as the commits that will be affected haven't been made public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rebasing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a rebase is the same as a merge, to bring two tree's of commits together. It differs in it's approach. Rebasing is a seriously sharp tool. Very powerful, but pretty easy to cut yourself with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you rebase one branch onto another, Git undoes any changes you've made in the target branch, brings it up to date with the changes made in the source branch, then replays your commits on top. This sounds quite strange, so I'll go over it step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start with your diverged branches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you then rebase feature onto master, Git undoes the changes in master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of both branches is now the same, master has been updated to reflect feature; the new commits that were made in master are now detached, floating in the repository without anything referencing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to replay the master commits onto the new structure. This is done one-by-one, and can sometimes result in conflicts that will need to be handled like any merge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After replaying the repository will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master branch commits are now on the top of the stack, after the commits from the feature branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should recall that commits are immutable, and for changes to be made commits need to be recreated. A rebase is a destructive operation, as it has to rewrite commits to be able to work. In this case, the commits from feature have been unaffected, but the master commits have been assigned new parents (and thus rewritten). What's also noticeable is there's a lack of a merge commit, which isn't needed because the commits have been integrated into the tree; any conflicts are stored in the amended commits, rather than in a merge commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rewriting of commits in a rebase is what makes it a dangerous operation to perform on any branch that has already been pushed to the public (or specifically, that the changes affected by the rebase have already been pushed to the public). A rebase can cause problems upstream, like mentioned in the previous section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebase has it's place though. If you're working locally and haven't yet pushed your changes public, it can be a useful tool. Rebase can be used to pull in changes from upstream in the order that the upstream repository has them, and your local changes (that can be rewritten because you're the only one with them) can be replayed on-top; this is a really easy way to keep your repository up-to-date with an authoritative source. You can also use Rebase to manage local branches that you don't necessarily want polluting the history with merge markers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When to rebase and when to merge?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merge when you've already made changes public, and when you want to indicate that two tree's have converged. Rebase pretty much any other time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for this time. Same deal as last time, if you have anything you'd like me to cover I'll nail it in the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git's guts: Branches, HEAD, and fast-forwards</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/gits-guts-branches-head-and-fast-forwards</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Cross posted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jagregory/archive/2009/11/25/git-s-guts-branches-head-and-fast-forwards.aspx&quot;&gt;Los Techies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets get some learning done. There are a few questions that keep cropping up when I introduce people to Git, so I thought I'd post some answers as a mini-series of blog posts. I'll cover some fundamentals, while trying not to retread too much ground that the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;http://book.git-scm.com&quot;&gt;Git community book&lt;/a&gt; already covers so well. Instead I'm going to talk about things that should help you understand what you and Git are doing day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What's a branch?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you're thinking. &lt;em&gt;&quot;C'mon, we know what a branch is&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. A branch is a copy of a source tree, that's maintained separately from it's parent; that's what we perceive a branch to be, and that's how we're used to dealing with them. Sometimes they're physical copies (VSS and TFS), other times they're lightweight copies (SVN), but they're copies non-the-less. Or are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets look at it a different way. &lt;em&gt;The Git way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git works a little differently than most other version control systems. It doesn't store changes using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding&quot;&gt;delta encoding&lt;/a&gt;, where complete files are built up by stacking differences contained in each commit. Instead, in Git each commit stores a snapshot of how the repository looked when the commit occurred; a commit also contains a bit of meta-data, author, date, but more importantly a reference to the parent of the commit (the previous commit, usually).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a bit weird, I know, but bare with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is a branch? Nothing more than a pointer to a commit (with a name). There's nothing physical about it, nothing is created, moved, copied, nothing. A branch contains no history, and has no idea of what it consists of beyond the reference to a single commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a stack of commits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts1_Figure1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The branch references the newest commit. If you were to make another commit in this branch, the branch's reference would be updated to point at the new commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts2_Figure2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history is built up by recursing over the commits through each's parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What's HEAD?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what a branch is, this one is easy. &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; is a reference to the latest commit in the branch you're in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these two branches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts1_Figure3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had master checked out, &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; would reference &lt;code&gt;e34fa33&lt;/code&gt;, the exact same commit that the master branch itself references. If you had feature checked out, &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; would reference &lt;code&gt;dde3e1&lt;/code&gt;. With that in mind, as both &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; and a branch is just a reference to a commit, it is sometimes said that &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; points to the current branch you're on; while this is not strictly true, in most circumstances it's close enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What's a fast-forward?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fast-forward is what Git does when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead the one you have checked-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the following branch setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts1_Figure4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've got both branches referencing the same commit. They've both got exactly the same history. Now commit something to feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts1_Figure5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch is still referencing &lt;code&gt;7ddac6c&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;feature&lt;/code&gt; has advanced by two commits. The &lt;code&gt;feature&lt;/code&gt; branch can now be considered ahead of &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's now quite easy to see what'll happen when Git does a fast-forward. It simply updates the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch to reference the same commit that &lt;code&gt;feature&lt;/code&gt; does. No changes are made to the repository itself, as the commits from &lt;code&gt;feature&lt;/code&gt; already contain all the necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your repository history would now look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts1_Figure6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When doesn't a fast-forward happen?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forwards don't happen in situations where changes have been made in the original branch and the new branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/GitGuts1_Figure7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to merge or rebase &lt;code&gt;feature&lt;/code&gt; onto &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;, Git would be unable to do a fast-forward because the trees have both diverged. Considering Git commits are immutable, there's no way for Git to get the commits from &lt;code&gt;feature&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; without changing their parent references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more info on all this object malarky, I'd recommend reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://book.git-scm.com&quot;&gt;Git community book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate 1.0 RTM</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-10-rtm</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that don't know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; is for helping you map entities with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nhforge.org&quot;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;. It's based firmly on the practice of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration&quot;&gt;convention-over-configuration&lt;/a&gt;, and can be used in a mapping-per-class style using our &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Fluent_mapping&quot;&gt;fluent interface&lt;/a&gt;, or let our &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Auto_mapping&quot;&gt;automapper&lt;/a&gt; map your entities itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release introduces a few significant changes, and a lot of insignificant ones. You should refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0&quot;&gt;1.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt; for an overview of what's changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; has also been upgraded to use different software which should hopefully stop people being blocked, and make it a bit more stable; the upgrade included completely rewriting all of the pages, so don't anyone say that it's out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get the binaries from the our &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads&quot;&gt;downloads page&lt;/a&gt;, or get the source from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate&quot;&gt;github site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks go out to the Fluent NHibernate team, Paul Batum, Hudson Akridge, Andrew Stewart, and Stuart Childs. Each of them has put in time and effort above what was asked of them, and they've all felt guilty when not contributing, which is great. Thanks also to all the testers and contributors we've had over the months. Specifically Darko Conrad, for finding about 30 separate issues with the release candidiate; Everett Muniz and his subclasses, who now has a test of his own; and Kevin Dente, for deciding to moan about our method names only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; months of work and a release candidate. I owe everyone beers if ever I'm in your area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabio Maulo, Ayende, and the rest of the NHibernate team: Thanks for a great tool. NHibernate is a shining example of all that is good in open source in the .Net world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and with that, I'm going on &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Sydney&amp;amp;daddr=Brisbane+to:Cairns&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;sll=-25.656382,152.880249&amp;amp;sspn=1.383954,1.851196&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=-25.522615,152.358398&amp;amp;spn=22.065278,29.619141&amp;amp;z=5&quot;&gt;holiday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Property getters with side-effects, now there's a controversial subject if ever I saw one. Don't do it is the rule; as with any rule though, there's generally an exception that proves it. If you're in this situation and you genuinely do have a scenario that requires a property getter to have side-effects, then there's a side-effect (ha!) that you should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The debugger evaluates property getters when showing it's locals and autos windows.&lt;/strong&gt; While this feature is indispensable in most cases, it plays havoc with our property-with-side-effects. What the debugger does is call the getter to present it's value in the autos window, at the same time firing our code that has a side-effect. From there you have pretty confusing behavior with code seemingly running itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My exception to the rule is mutator properties in a fluent interface. You can often find properties in fluent interfaces that when touched alter the behavior of the next method called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns true
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns false
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Is class would contain a value tracking whether the next call would be inverted or not, and the Not property would flip that value when called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now assume this, you're using &lt;code&gt;Is.Null(value)&lt;/code&gt; and you set a breakpoint on it. Your autos window has expanded Is and shows the Not property, what's just happened? The debugger has now called Not and altered your state! Undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerbrowsableattribute.aspx&quot;&gt;DebuggerBrowsable attribute&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue; this attribute when used with the DebuggerBrowsableState.Never parameter instructs Visual Studio to never inspect the property you apply it to. Your property won't appear in the autos or locals window, and if you expand the tree of an instance containing the property it will show up with a Browsing Disabled message; you can then force it to evaluate the property, but at least it doesn't do it automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inverted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[DebuggerBrowsable(DebuggerBrowsableState.Never)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Not&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inverted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inverted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sticking the DebuggerBrowsable attribute on your Not property prevents the debugger from hitting it and inverting the switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go, if your property-with-side-effects is being invoked by the debugger, you can use the DebuggerBrowsableAttribute to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the way, I'm not advocating properties with side-effects...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate 1.0RC</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-10rc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's nearly here, at long last &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; has nearly reached 1.0. Now starts the official public testing of our 1.0RC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; on the wiki for more information on what's changed. There have been a lot of small breaking changes in the fluent interface, mostly reducing it's verbosity, and a few larger changes elsewhere. Don't expect to download this and have it &lt;em&gt;just work&lt;/em&gt;, because it won't; hopefully it shouldn't be too painful though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is that this is a very quick turnaround for a release candidate. It's already undergone some heavy testing from some respected volunteers, but I wanted to get it into the public eye for a week or so before release. Ideally the RTM release won't differ from this one at all, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the binaries on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads&quot;&gt;downloads page&lt;/a&gt;, and it's now included in the binary build releases too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions should be directed to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate&quot;&gt;mailing-list&lt;/a&gt;, and issues onto our &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/issues/list&quot;&gt;issue list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git and command-line fear</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/git-and-command-line-fear</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-posted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jagregory/archive/2009/07/20/git-s-and-command-line-fear.aspx&quot;&gt;Los Techies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.org&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; has been gaining a lot of traction lately, and rightly so. I've used it for a couple of years now, for all my projects (&lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docu.jagregory.com&quot;&gt;Docu&lt;/a&gt; being the prominent ones), but something that hasn't changed is the tag-line of &quot;but Windows support isn't very good!&quot;. What you quickly learn is that when people say that, they actually mean there isn't a Visual Studio plug-in or some similar all-singing all-dancing GUI; this is a dire misrepresentation of Git, because it's tooling on Windows is excellent if your definition of tooling includes the command-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's something ingrained in Windows developers, they hate the command-line. There's a very good chance that if you encounter a Windows developer that does enjoy using the command-line it's because they've also worked on another platform or in another environment that encourages command-line use (Rails is a good example). I've tried various ways of encouraging people to experiment, but very few work without being able to sit down and just show them something. It's very much like R# adoption, nobody thinks it'll speed them up until they see how fast someone else can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back onto Git. If you don't like what Git does, then that's fine, but don't label yourself as Alt.Net or a continuous improver if this sounds like you: &quot;I define myself by choosing the best tool for each situation, but there's no way you'll get me using the command-line.&quot; Way to go, oh open-minded one. Try it, you might like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other techies have been posting some great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/tags/git/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Git posts&lt;/a&gt; which can help you get up to speed. I hope to contribute, with less bile, soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What's been happening in Fluent NHibernate land?</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/whats-been-happening-in-fluent-nhibernate-land</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Cross-posted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jagregory.lostechies.com/archive/2009/04/28/what-s-been-happening-in-fluent-nhibernate-land.aspx&quot;&gt;Los Techies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; has seen a flurry of development followed by a complete lack of commits, I figure it’s time to let everyone know what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Short Version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re rewriting the internals. We have 100% of tests passing, but still can’t guarantee no regressions. Stuff may break, if it does, &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate&quot;&gt;tell us&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Long Version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluent NHibernate at it’s core is a fluent interface over xml generation. We use the series of methods you call in your mappings to build up an in-memory hbm xml document that we then feed to NHibernate. Slowly, as we’ve started to support more and more of NHibernate’s features, we’ve started to find flaws in our architecture. It amounts to us not having enough separation of concerns; our fluent interface is generating xml, I think most people would say that’s not a good thing. Our xml is being generated too soon in the cycle to allow us to do more clever things that’d improve the user’s experience. That’s where the quiet time comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulbatum.com&quot;&gt;Paul Batum&lt;/a&gt; undertook the task of redesigning the internals of Fluent NHibernate to be something much more scalable. I’ll leave the details out for now (maybe a future post), but it amounts to a intermediary layer being introduced between the fluent interface and the xml generation. We’ve dubbed this the Semantic Model, and it’s that which is now generated by the fluent interface, then later translated into xml. This added abstraction allows us to do things that weren’t possible while we were just generating straight xml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst you wont see any immediate improvements while everything is being converted, the extra layer allows us to inspect the model before it is converted to xml; this gives us some immense capabilities, such as allowing subclasses to be separate from their parent mapping, create reusable component mappings, improve relationship support etc… We’re pretty much limited only by what we can imagine now, rather than by architectural decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we have a dilemma. The semantic-model branch has deviated so much from trunk we’ve got a major merge problem. A merge is pretty much out of the question actually, because there’s barely any commonality between the two streams at all. It was then assumed that the branch would eventually replace trunk (we’d just rename trunk to a tag, then rename the semantic-model branch to trunk), and all we needed to do was get the branch up-to-date with the features of trunk. Little did we realise we were essentially committing to something that I typically oppose, a complete rewrite! I’ve never been in a situation where that’s ever been a good idea, and yet here we are, responsible for our own destiny as it was, and we’d chosen a rewrite!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks went by with very little work happening. I think we’d all started feeling demoralised by the idea of re-implementing most of the features from trunk using the new design. It was a worthwhile endeavor, definitely, but just very uninteresting. We repeatedly swore that we’d get this done, but all the while we felt less inclined to support trunk because every new feature meant a new feature to port too. We stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bestguesstheory.com/&quot;&gt;Hudson Akridge&lt;/a&gt;, our newest contributor, had the balls to tell me that he thought what we were doing felt pretty futile. At that moment I gained a great deal of respect for him, as it’s something that was in the back of my mind for some time but I wasn’t ready to face yet. It was that which got me moving again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down over a long weekend and took on the mammoth task of merging our rewrite branch and trunk, with the aim of allowing the existing code to exist alongside the new code; this approach, if it worked, would allow us to convert existing features at our own pace while still writing new features for the cleaner codebase. After a lot of unpleasant hacking of nice code, I managed to get all our existing tests passing while utilising the semantic model behind the scenes. Our old code still directly generates xml, which then gets injected into the semantic model via a nasty shortcut. It feels dirty, because I’ve had to comprimise some good code to get it working, but in a way I think that’s a good thing; if code is nasty, we’re all less likely to be content with it. The main goal was achieved though, and that was to allow us to work at our own pace on trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where we stand now is three branches, trunk, integration, and semantic-model. Over the next day or so I am going to merge integration with trunk, which will mean the semantic model will be in use for new features. From there we can slowly migrate all the original code to use our new semantic model, all the while adding new features using it, then eventually remove the duct-tape that’s holding the legacy code to the new code and dump the old stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I’ll give you a little warning: although we have 100% of tests passing, we don’t have 100% coverage. There may be some regressions that we aren’t aware of. If anyone finds anything broken that was working before, contact us immediately on the &lt;a href=&quot;groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; or via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/issues/list&quot;&gt;issues list&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll correct it. Regressions will be treated with the highest priority over any other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, you now know more about what’s happening with Fluent NHibernate than you ever wanted to. I hope this sheds a little light onto what’s been happening with us, and perhaps why your patch hasn’t been applied as quickly as you would’ve liked.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate usage stats</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-usage-stats</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just been totting up some figures on how &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; is doing, thought I’d share them with anyone that’s interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These are very rough figures, generated with no scientific consistency, some are cumulative and others are based just on the last full month. They're more just to satisfy my curiosity than to be rigorously accurate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Downloads&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1,800 per month&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Unique visitors&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5,500 per month&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Page views&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;13,000 per month&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Mailing list messages&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;450 per month&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Commits&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;45 per month&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;


Something else that's interesting is of those 5,500 visitors/13,000 page views, 66% are coming directly from google, 4% directly, then the other 30% from referrers. Those referrers are broken down into (from highest to lowest): &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jagregory.com&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pnpguidance.net&quot;&gt;pnpguidance.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nhforge.org&quot;&gt;nhforge&lt;/a&gt;, then quite a few other sites forming the lower percentages. I'm surprised at how high Stack Overflow is, I guess it pays that I pay attention to questions asked about Fluent on there.

Those download numbers are probably not representative either as they're only of the zip files, while I believe the vast majority of people run off the trunk through Subversion, so it's hard to count them.


&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

      <title>Docu + 2 days</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/docu-2-days</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been two days since I &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/introducing-docu-simple-doc-gen-for-net/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://docu.jagregory.com&quot;&gt;docu&lt;/a&gt;, my simple documentation generator for .Net apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reception it’s received has been positive, I never expected it to have a surge of popularity because it’s not that kind of tool, so it hasn’t come as much of a surprise that people haven’t been jumping all over it. Having said that though, I have had some good feedback and already someone has contributed a patch. Additionally, there hasn’t been one question as to why I’ve created it; now this has come as a surprise, I guess I’m &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the only one that feels Sandcastle is bloated and overcomplicated. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just pushed out some changes to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/docu&quot;&gt;github repos&lt;/a&gt; and released an updated alpha (v0.1.0.2) on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docu.jagregory.com/downloads&quot;&gt;downloads page&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest changes so far are the inclusion of events and fields in the parsing, which now means docu has &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;summary /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; support for all documentable members. The rest of the changes are mainly refactorings and some battle-hardening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some more changes and several issues lined up, so keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Docu - Simple doc gen for .Net</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/introducing-docu-simple-doc-gen-for-net</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lets look at a recent Twitter conversation of mine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone have any tips on generating html docs from XML comments? Used to do it years ago with NDoc &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1312895270&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Man, sandcastle is so overly complex &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313079815&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sandcastle examples don&amp;#8217;t even work. This is shit. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313167377&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why isn&amp;#8217;t sandcastle just a console app that takes a list of dlls and spits out html/chm? What&amp;#8217;s with all the batch files and XslTransforms? &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1313112789&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;@AndrewNStewart Well Sandcastle requires chaining together several calls to 3+ applications before you get anything. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315443964&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Are these Sandcastle generated MSDN-style API docs actually useful to anyone? &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315364767&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;@pollingj It&amp;#8217;s a dilemma. I don&amp;#8217;t care about API docs, but people seem to want it, but I&amp;#8217;m reluctant to generate msdn-like shit. Dilemma. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jagregory/status/1315455082&quot;&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, dilemma. People want API documentation (for &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; specifically), but I don&amp;#8217;t want to associate myself with the awful MSDN-style documentation that&amp;#8217;s produced by Sandcastle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you get all hot under the collar, if you like Sandcastle, or you like MSDN-style documentation, leave now. Use what works for you, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for me so I&amp;#8217;m not using it, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to stop you using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise the market for this tool is probably pretty small, but it&amp;#8217;s useful to me so it might be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing &lt;a href=&quot;http://docu.jagregory.com&quot;&gt;docu&lt;/a&gt;, the simple documentation generator for .Net!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docu is a tool that produces an html site (or rather, a collection of html pages) from the doc-comments you include in your code. Given an assembly and the Visual Studio produced XML of the comments, docu will produce a completely static collection of pages that you can publish anywhere you like. You run it through one command-line tool, with one parameter. That&amp;#8217;s it, nothing complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background: #CCC;color: #000;padding: 2px;&quot;&gt;docu your-assembly.dll&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see an example of the default style that&amp;#8217;s provided in the Fluent NHibernate &lt;a href=&quot;http://fluentnhibernate.org/api/index.htm&quot;&gt;API docs&lt;/a&gt; (the colour scheme has been modified, but everything else is default).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docu is completely stand alone, no GAC deployed assemblies, no hard-coded paths, no nothing. This makes it trivial to use docu in your CI process for building up-to-the-second API docs for publishing or downloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The templates that docu uses are created with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sparkviewengine.com&quot;&gt;Spark view engine&lt;/a&gt; which means you have all the power of C# and it&amp;#8217;s templating language at your finger-tips. If you&amp;#8217;re particularly picky about appearance (like I am) then you can completely rewrite the templates to your heart&amp;#8217;s content. There&amp;#8217;s no imposed structure or style, it&amp;#8217;s all customisable through the templates. You can read more about customising templates on the site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://docu.jagregory.com/customising-templates&quot;&gt;customising templates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting little feature of the templating system is &lt;em&gt;special names&lt;/em&gt; for directories and files, for example if you name a template &lt;code&gt;!namespace.spark&lt;/code&gt;, a html page will be produced for a each namespace in your assembly using that template. This allows you to do things like create a directory for each namespace, with a page for each type in that namespace inside. Pretty powerful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codebase is reasonably well structured, but the code itself is a bit untidy. Luckily it&amp;#8217;s covered by nearly 200 unit tests (so far) and i&amp;#8217;ll be leveraging them to improve the code quality over time. You can checkout the code from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/docu&quot;&gt;docu github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's early days yet, there's very little customisation of the documentation process (the part that actually finds the types and members to document), and not all comment types are supported yet; however, it's used for Fluent NHibernate and works pretty well. It's only Alpha right now, so you shouldn't expect the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if this kind-of thing interests you, go have a read of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docu.jagregory.com&quot;&gt;docu website&lt;/a&gt; and let me know how it works out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Conventions Rewrite</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-conventions-rewrite</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just committed a rather large update to the Fluent NHibernate conventions code. This post explains why I&amp;#8217;ve done this, and gives you some starting points to update your code. Anything else you need can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Conventions&quot;&gt;conventions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Converting-to-new-style-conventions&quot;&gt;converting to new-style conventions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why have I rewritten conventions?&lt;/strong&gt; Our original implementation was simple, but not really maintainable into the future. It was a single class that was a major violation of separation of concerns, and it just kept growing and growing. It didn&amp;#8217;t gracefully degrade either; if we didn&amp;#8217;t have the exact convention you needed it was tough luck, there was very little you could do short of modifying the code yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our original design worked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithConventions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conventions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conventions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TableName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Table&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conventions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DefaultLazy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&amp;#8217;s a fairly simple design. Lambda functions were set that got called in various places throughout the mapping generation cycle. It was a good design for simple scenarios; however, when you start overriding more conventions, and introducing logic into them, it can quickly become a massive ball of mud. So while there was an initial simplicity to it, that simplicity was quickly lost if you were trying to do anything clever with it. This is another thing that the rewrite aims to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how have things changed?&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to define conventions inline is gone, for starters. Instead what you have is a series of interfaces of varying degrees of granularity; any classes implementing any of the interfaces will be automagically hooked into the mapping generation cycle. What this equates to is you&amp;#8217;ll have a folder/namespace in your projects dedicated to conventions, each class making an alteration to the conventions when it&amp;#8217;s called. As each convention is an interface, it means you can implement multiples of them in a single class, which allows you to group common conventions into a single class if you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example_customising_the_table_name&quot;&gt;Example: Customising the table name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TableNameConvention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IClassConvention&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IClassMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// apply to all mappings
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IClassMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// will produce table names like: tbl_Customer, tbl_Product
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;tbl_&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EntityType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple implementation of the &lt;code&gt;IClassConvention&lt;/code&gt; interface, which is applied to all class mappings (hence the &lt;code&gt;return true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Accept&lt;/code&gt;) and simply prefixes the table name with &lt;code&gt;tbl_&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example_adding_your_conventions&quot;&gt;Example: Adding your conventions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s one thing you need to do to get Fluent NHibernate to use your conventions, and that&amp;#8217;s to inform the convention discovery mechanism of where it&amp;#8217;s to search for conventions. You do this using the &lt;code&gt;PersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt;s &lt;code&gt;CovnentionFinder&lt;/code&gt; property, or through the &lt;code&gt;ConventionDiscovery&lt;/code&gt; property through &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/FluentConfiguration&quot;&gt;Fluent Configuration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fluently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FluentMappings&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionDiscovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MyConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all there is to it really, certainly from a users perspective anyway. The architecture is designed in such a way that you have a much greater control of the granularity of your conventions; if you need a convention we haven&amp;#8217;t explicitly supplied, you can use the convention &amp;#8220;above&amp;#8221; the one you want, and implement it yourself. If you need a convention for just Bag collections (which we don&amp;#8217;t have one for), you just need to create an implementation of &lt;code&gt;IHasManyConvention&lt;/code&gt; and limit it to bags. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some_shortcuts&quot;&gt;Some shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise that the new design is more verbose than it was originally, and if your scenario really is one that only uses one or two conventions, then the new design might be too much for you. To cater for you people, I&amp;#8217;ve created some basic inline support. I really don&amp;#8217;t recommend you use these unless you&amp;#8217;re doing something &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; simple. Separation is always preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s the &lt;code&gt;ConventionBuilder&lt;/code&gt; class which has several static properties (&lt;code&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; for example, there&amp;#8217;s one for each convention) which allow you to create an inline convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Always&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;SetAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;something&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Always&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ColumnName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;When&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ColumnName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Num&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These can be used directly in the &lt;code&gt;ConventionDiscovery&lt;/code&gt; property mentioned above; it has an &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; method that can take a params array of conventions, there&amp;#8217;s also a &lt;code&gt;Setup&lt;/code&gt; method which can be used for multiple additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionDiscovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Always&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;SetAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;something&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;true&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Always&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ColumnName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionDiscovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MyConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConventionBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Always&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ColumnName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, there&amp;#8217;s a limited selection of very common conventions which can be used inline. Again, I don&amp;#8217;t advocate using these for anything complicated. If you start having logic in your conventions, or even if the lambdas end up being multi-line, I&amp;#8217;d suggest using the full conventions. These helpers live in the &lt;code&gt;FluentNHibernate.Conventions.Helpers&lt;/code&gt; namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;tbl_&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EntityType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PrimaryKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DynamicUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AlwaysTrue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These can be used in the same way as the &lt;code&gt;ConventionBuilder&lt;/code&gt; above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regarding_auto_mapping&quot;&gt;Regarding auto mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auto mapper uses a small subset of conventions to discover various parts of your mappings. It was originally the case that these special conventions were lumped in with the rest of the conventions, even though you couldn&amp;#8217;t use them outside of the automapper. As the old style conventions have gone, the automapper now has a separate set of conventions (they&amp;#8217;re the same ones, just moved) that it uses. So in addition to the &lt;code&gt;ConventionDiscovery&lt;/code&gt; property, the auto mapper has a &lt;code&gt;WithSetup&lt;/code&gt; method that you can use to configure the auto mapping specific ones (&lt;code&gt;IsBaseType&lt;/code&gt; primarily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further_reading&quot;&gt;Further reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this post should have given you a basic introduction to the changes I&amp;#8217;ve made. To go further, you&amp;#8217;re going to have to know what &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Available-conventions&quot;&gt;interfaces are available&lt;/a&gt; to implement. You should probably also read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Convertings&quot;&gt;general conventions&lt;/a&gt; wiki, how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Converting-to-new-style-conventions&quot;&gt;convert your existing conventions&lt;/a&gt; to the new style, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Convention-shortcut&quot;&gt;convention shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; if it interests you. For maintainers, or just curious people, there&amp;#8217;s also the wiki on how the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/Conventions&quot;&gt;conventions work behind-the-scenes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Auto mapping, overrides and alterations</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-auto-mapping-overrides-and-alterations</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an excerpt from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Auto-mapping&quot;&gt;Auto Mapping&lt;/a&gt; wiki page. It is recommended you refer to those pages for the latest version of this content, as this blog post will not be maintained for correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using the Auto Mapping facilities of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; you can use the &lt;code&gt;ForMappingsThatDeriveFrom&lt;/code&gt; method described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Auto-mapping&quot;&gt;Altering Entities&lt;/a&gt; to override the mappings for specific entities, but that can quickly become cluttered if you&amp;#8217;re having to alter many entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to use an &lt;code&gt;IAutoMappingOverride&lt;t&gt;, which is an interface you can implement to override the mappings of a particular auto-mapped class.

``` csharp
public class PersonMappingOverride : IAutoMappingOverride&lt;person&gt;
{
  public void Override(AutoMap&lt;person&gt; mapping)
  {
  }
}
```

&lt;p&gt;This example overrides the auto-mapping of a &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; entity. Within the &lt;code&gt;Override&lt;/code&gt; method you can perform any actions on the mapping that you can in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Fluent-mapping&quot;&gt;Fluent Mappings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use overrides, you need to instruct your &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt; instance to use them. Typically this would be done in the context of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Fluent-configuration&quot;&gt;Fluent Configuration&lt;/a&gt; setup, but I&amp;#8217;ll just illustrate with the &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt; on it&amp;#8217;s own.&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
AutoPersistenceModel.MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;person&gt;()
  .Where(type =&amp;gt; type.Namespace == &quot;Entities&quot;)
  .UseOverridesFromAssemblyOf&lt;personmappingoverride&gt;();
```

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the &lt;code&gt;UserOverridesFromAssemblyOf&lt;t&gt; call that instructs the &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt; to read any overrides that reside the assembly that contains &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;These overrides are made possible with use of the configuration alteration capabilities of the &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt;. You can use these features yourself to create your own customisations, or simply to separate your configuration into logical sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alteration is an implementation of the &lt;code&gt;IAutoMappingAlteration&lt;/code&gt; interface, and is a self contained piece of configuration logic that can be applied with others to an &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt; prior to any mappings being generated. These are simple to use, but very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
public class WhereAlteration : IAutoMappingAlteration
{
  public void Alter(AutoPersistenceModel model)
  {
    model.Where(type =&amp;gt; IsMappable(type));
  }

  private bool IsMappable(Type type)
  {
    // some logic
  }
}
```

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Alter(AutoPersistenceModel model)&lt;/code&gt; method is where you place your logic for altering the model, you can do anything in here you like. The overrides functionality, for example, inspects an assembly looking for any &lt;code&gt;IMappingOverride&lt;t&gt; instances and executes each one against the model.

&lt;p&gt;You need to instruct your &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt; to use any alterations you may have, and you do that using the &lt;code&gt;WithAlterations&lt;/code&gt; method. Typically this would be done in the context of a FluentConfiguration setup, but I&amp;#8217;ll just illustrate with the &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt; on it&amp;#8217;s own.&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
AutoPersistenceModel.MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;person&gt;()  
  .WithAlterations(alterations =&amp;gt;
    alterations.AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;wherealteration&gt;());
```

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;WithAlterations&lt;/code&gt; method takes a lambda action that allows you to set multiple alterations on your model; you can add single alterations with &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt;, and everything from an assembly like the above example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before your mappings are generated, the alterations are all run against the &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt;. There&amp;#8217;s currently no ordering of alterations, so you cannot rely on the ability to stack alterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/wherealteration&gt;&lt;/person&gt;&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/personmappingoverride&gt;&lt;/person&gt;&lt;/person&gt;&lt;/person&gt;&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate - The official website</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-the-official-website</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Documentation? What documentation!&amp;#8221; I hear you say. Yes, Fluent NHibernate is not best known for it&amp;#8217;s abundance of documentation. I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve realised that over the past couple of months Fluent NHibernate has been growing in popularity, stupidly so. We&amp;#8217;ve got new features out the bjingo, an active mailing list, and a flow of people moaning on twitter. Well I figure enough is enough, we need a proper website; googlecode is great for hosting, but it&amp;#8217;s wiki is poor, we needed something better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Announcing the official Fluent NHibernate website:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;http://fluentnhibernate.org&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, comments are welcome on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. Please, no porn on the wiki just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be updating all my recent blog posts to point to the appropriate content on the wiki, and I would prefer if people would direct-link to the website rather than the googlecode project from now on. We&amp;#8217;ll still be using googlecode for hosting and issue tracking, but the wiki will be cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any wiki, the content is not final, and not exhaustive. I'm working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent green and brown</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-green-and-brown</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To paint a very black-and-white picture, there are two camps of applications: greenfield and brownfield. Greenfield are generally nice, they have good separation of concerns, probably an IoC container, they may even be covered by unit tests. Brownfield apps are not. They generally don’t have great separation of concerns (they’re usually pretty concerned about everything), they definitely don’t have great unit test coverage (but you’re working on it!), and they don’t have IoC containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re designing a framework you need to cater for both these markets. Unfortunately, they’re both at odds with each other. A design that caters for inversion of control can sometimes be too verbose or “bitty” to use easily without a container. Similarly, if designed without a container in mind it will fall short for use with one; it’ll be too tightly nit, too hard to break apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although when Fluent NHibernate was started it was heading towards a design for greenfield, when I took over I steered it in the direction I thought was most important - brownfield. Fluent NHibernate has been aimed at being a drop-in replacement for your traditional NHibernate setup, simply replace your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CreateSessionFactory&lt;/code&gt; method with ours and you’re away. The problem is, by focussing so hard on brownfield, I’ve neglected the green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not apologising, because nobody has complained, but considerations need to be made for the other half. I still very much believe that Fluent NHibernate is heading in the right direction, we want to make life easier for those people who’s lives are pretty damn hard (those greenfield guys have it easy anyway); however, I do believe considerations need to be made to allow Fluent NHibernate to be more accessible for those of us who have the pleasure of working in a well designed system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the future hold for Fluent NHibernate?&lt;/strong&gt; Supporting all of NHibernate’s mapping options, making the automapper a lot more powerful, improving testability even more, and finally… giving some love to the PersistenceModel and SessionSource that the greenfield guys need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Configuring your application</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-configuring-your-application</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; The content in this post may be out of date, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Fluent-configuration&quot;&gt;Fluent Configuration&lt;/a&gt; page in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s been a grey area of how to actually configure your application to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;, and also how to configure some more complicated situations (such as mixing fluent and non-fluent mappings). After some thought I&amp;#8217;ve committed a change that should make things clearer. What follows is a few examples of how this new API can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to assume that you&amp;#8217;ve got an application already set up, or you know how to structure a standard NHibernate application. If you don&amp;#8217;t, I suggest you read up on that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the examples that follow are tailored to directly replace your &lt;code&gt;SessionFactory&lt;/code&gt; instantiation code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing_the_configuration_api&quot;&gt;Introducing the configuration API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now &lt;code&gt;Fluently.Configure&lt;/code&gt; your application. The API is broken down into five main methods, three of which are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fluently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* your database settings */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* your mappings */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ExposeConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* alter Configuration */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// optional
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can combine these methods in various ways to setup your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fluently.Configure&lt;/code&gt; starts the configuration process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Database&lt;/code&gt; is where you specify your database configuration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mappings&lt;/code&gt; is where you supply which mappings you&amp;#8217;re using&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExposeConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; is optional, but allows you to alter the raw Configuration object&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/code&gt; is the final call, and it creates the NHibernate SessionFactory instance from your configuration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exclusively_fluent&quot;&gt;Exclusively fluent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in the situation where your application is exclusively using fluent mappings, then this is the configuration for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fluently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SQLiteConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InMemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FluentMappings&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup uses the SQLite database configuration, but you can substitute that with your own; it then adds any fluent mappings from the assebly that contains &lt;code&gt;YourEntity&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automappings&quot;&gt;Automappings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re using only auto mappings, then this config is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fluently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SQLiteConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InMemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoMappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// your automapping setup here
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Namspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EndsWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Entities&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the code inside &lt;code&gt;AutoMappings.Add&lt;/code&gt; with your auto mapping configuration. You can see more about auto mappings in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jagregory.com/tag/automapping/&quot;&gt;automapping tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mixed_fluent_mappings_and_auto_mappings&quot;&gt;Mixed fluent mappings and auto mappings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re using a combination of standard fluent mappings and auto mappings, then this example should show you how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fluently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SQLiteConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InMemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FluentMappings&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoMappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// your automapping setup here
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Namspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EndsWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Entities&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that this is a combination of the two previous examples, the &lt;code&gt;Mappings&lt;/code&gt; method can accept multiple kinds of mappings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hbm_mappings&quot;&gt;HBM mappings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve not yet got around to using Fluent NHibernate fully, but you are configuring your database with it; this configuration will let you configure your database and add your traditional hbm mappings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fluently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SQLiteConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InMemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HbmMappings&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;HbmMappings&lt;/code&gt; property allows you to add HBM XML mappings in a few different ways, this example adds everything from an assembly which defines &lt;code&gt;YourEntity&lt;/code&gt;; however, you can add from an assembly instance, or just add single types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mixed_hbm_and_fluent_mappings&quot;&gt;Mixed HBM and fluent mappings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re migrating your entities to Fluent NHibernate but haven&amp;#8217;t quite got them all across yet - this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fluently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SQLiteConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InMemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HbmMappings&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FluentMappings&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_whole_shebang_fluent_auto_and_hbm_mappings&quot;&gt;The whole shebang: fluent, auto, and hbm mappings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re a crazy fool and map a bit of everything, then this is how you&amp;#8217;d configure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Fluently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SQLiteConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InMemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HbmMappings&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FluentMappings&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoMappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// your automapping setup here
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Namspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EndsWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Entities&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exporting_hbmxml_mappings&quot;&gt;Exporting hbm.xml mappings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;Mappings&lt;/code&gt; call, you can do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FluentMappings&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ExportTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&quot;C:\your\export\path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoMappings&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(...)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ExportTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&quot;C:\your\export\path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will export all of your fluent and automapped mappings in hbm.xml format to whatever location you specify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;altering_nonautomapped_conventions&quot;&gt;Altering non-automapped conventions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to override conventions that are used by your non-automapped classes, then you can use the &lt;code&gt;AlterConventions&lt;/code&gt; method on &lt;code&gt;FluentMappings&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Mappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FluentMappings&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;YourEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AlterConventions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conventions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conventions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsBaseType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BaseType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;validation&quot;&gt;Validation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you forget to setup your database, or don&amp;#8217;t add any mappings, instead of pulling out your hair over obscure NHibernate exceptions, the &lt;code&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/code&gt; method will throw a more helpful exception to try to point you in the right direction. It&amp;#8217;ll tell you whether you&amp;#8217;ve forgot to add any entities, or not setup your database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for now, I hope this helps to make configuring your application a little clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I think you mean a many-to-one, sir</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/i-think-you-mean-a-many-to-one-sir</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question that crops up &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, in various forms, on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/nhusers&quot;&gt;NHibernate Users&lt;/a&gt; mailing lists. &lt;em&gt;My one-to-one mapping isn&amp;#8217;t working, what&amp;#8217;s wrong?&lt;/em&gt; aka Incorrectly using a one-to-one relationship when you actually need a many-to-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a common misunderstanding where people try to use a one-to-one relationship where a many-to-one is appropriate. I believe this is because people tend to get tunnel vision when designing their entities, which leads them to make incorrect assumptions. They focus on one entity at a time, and when that has a single entity related to it, they jump to the conclusion it&amp;#8217;s a one-to-one they need; after all, there&amp;#8217;s their current entity (one) and the related entity (to-one). They&amp;#8217;re actually forgetting that there can be multiple instances of their &lt;em&gt;current entity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a big distinction between what&amp;#8217;s possible in the domain, and what&amp;#8217;s possible by design in the database; for example, two businesses may &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; share an address in your application, but in the database there&amp;#8217;s nothing stopping two rows in the Business table from referencing the same address row in the database. This is logic that can be applied on-top of a database design, but there&amp;#8217;s nothing in the underlying pattern to disallow it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manytoone&quot;&gt;Many-to-one&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets have a look at what actually is a many-to-one. Here&amp;#8217;s a small database schema and the related entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddressId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a standard many-to-one relationship, many &lt;code&gt;Customers&lt;/code&gt; to one &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt;; the tables are linked by the &lt;code&gt;AddressId&lt;/code&gt; key in the &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; table. You can see how people can misinterpret this as a one-to-one relationship when designing the Customer entity; the customer has one address, so it must be a one-to-one. People forget about this scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;db-table&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Customer&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Id&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;AddressId&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Plumbers&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Joiners&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Roofers&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;db-table&quot;&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Address&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Id&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Number&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Street&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Baker St.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;47&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Jefferson Ave.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the first and third customer both reference the first address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onetoone&quot;&gt;One-to-one&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what actually is a one-to-one relationship then?&lt;/strong&gt; A one-to-one is a relationship between two tables that share a mutually exclusive primary key value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see in this design &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; has no direct reference to &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt;, the two tables share a primary key value; so there would be a record in &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; with a primary key of &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, and a record in &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; that also has a primary key of &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s fairly common to have the primary key on the second table (&lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; in our case) be manually inserted on creation of a record in the first, so it may only be the first table that has a true auto-incrementing primary key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also noticeable that both examples have exactly the same class design, this probably contributes to the confusion too, as it&amp;#8217;s not immediately clear from the class what kind of relationship it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just remember this: &lt;strong&gt;if you think you&amp;#8217;re mapping a one-to-one, you probably aren&amp;#8217;t!&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s pretty uncommon to find a one-to-one relationship in a properly designed schema, 90% of the time it&amp;#8217;ll be a many-to-one you need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to static reflection</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/introduction-to-static-reflection</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;This post could've also been called &quot;Fluent NHibernate secrets exposed!&quot; but it sounded a bit sensationalist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard people mention static reflection recently, quite possibly because it&amp;#8217;s used extensively in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx&quot;&gt;Rhino Mocks&lt;/a&gt;, and I believe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/&quot;&gt;Jimmy Bogard&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/AutoMapper&quot;&gt;AutoMapper&lt;/a&gt; also uses it; pretty much any of the new &amp;#8220;fluent&amp;#8221; interfaces use some kind of static reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what actually is static reflection?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it&amp;#8217;s a statically compiled way of utilising the Reflection API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, if you wanted to use the Reflection API to interrogate your classes, you&amp;#8217;d need to utilise strings to refer to properties and methods; this can make your design quite brittle, because you have to make sure these strings are kept up-to-date whenever you rename anything. What&amp;#8217;s worse is that because reflection is late-bound, you aren&amp;#8217;t aware of the problems until the code is actually executed, so this renaming could introduce hidden bugs that don&amp;#8217;t appear until runtime. With the growing popularity of refactoring techniques, it&amp;#8217;s becoming more important that we can use reflection without having to worry about this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s very true that tools like Resharper can certainly help with refactoring reflection-based code, but none of them are perfect and they only help the people that use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C# 3 we were introduced to lambda expressions and Linq, and with them came the &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Expression&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes; these are the key to static reflection. The &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; set of classes allow you to use lambda expressions that return a value, while an &lt;code&gt;Expression&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be used to programatically access the contents of a delegate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Expression&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can give us a very powerful way to statically retrieve &lt;code&gt;PropertyInfo&lt;/code&gt; (and similar) instances from a lambda expression. For example &lt;code&gt;Expression&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;Customer, object&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents an expression that contains a delegate that returns a value (of type object), with a &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; parameter; I&amp;#8217;ll illustrate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// method to receive an expression
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyInfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// usage
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this is actually doing is creating a lambda that returns a value, the value of &lt;code&gt;customer.Name&lt;/code&gt; in this case. Here&amp;#8217;s the trick, we don&amp;#8217;t actually care about the value that&amp;#8217;s returned! In-fact, we don&amp;#8217;t even evaluate this expression at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we use &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt; signature, rather than a more specific type, is because we want to allow &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; property to be used; however, if you were only interested in &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; properties, then you could restrict it by replacing this parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Expression&lt;/code&gt; API itself is very in-depth, so I won&amp;#8217;t go into the intricacies of it but here&amp;#8217;s a very simple implementation of static reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyInfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;memberExpression&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MemberExpression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;memberExpression&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;InvalidOperationException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Not a member access.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;memberExpression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Member&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Should account for FieldInfo too
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping through this code, we start by getting the body of the expression which we cast to a &lt;code&gt;MemberExpression&lt;/code&gt;; this is us grabbing the &lt;code&gt;customer.Name&lt;/code&gt; part of our expression. Now we can get the member itself and cast it to a &lt;code&gt;PropertyInfo&lt;/code&gt;, this is the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; part of the expression body. That&amp;#8217;s it! We&amp;#8217;ve not evaluated the expression, but we&amp;#8217;ve inspected it and retrieved the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example is for illustrative purposes, there are many different types of expressions which would be excluded by this. If you are to implement your own static reflection parser, you should cater for these other types of expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this example shows, we&amp;#8217;re able to use reflection without having to resort to strings. The great thing about this is that if you change the name of a member inside a lambda, you&amp;#8217;ll get a compile error if you haven&amp;#8217;t updated all the references! No more hidden bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s how the magic behind Fluent NHibernate (and others) works, simple when you know how!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Auto mapping and base-classes</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-auto-mapping-and-base-classes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Carrying on with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; Auto Mapping theme, I&amp;#8217;ll now demonstrate how to map inheritance hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main things that you&amp;#8217;d want to do with inherited classes, either ignore the base class all together, or map them using an inheritance strategy. I&amp;#8217;m going to start with the former, then move on to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ignoring_basetypes&quot;&gt;Ignoring base-types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is where you may have a base class in your domain that you use to simplify your entities, you&amp;#8217;ve moved common properties into it so you don&amp;#8217;t have to recreate them on every entity; typically this would be the Id and perhaps some audit information. So lets start with a model that has a base class we&amp;#8217;d like to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Entities&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Entity&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entity&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FirstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;LastName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entity&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Species&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatively simple model here, we&amp;#8217;ve got an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; base class that defines the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, then the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; entities. We have no desire to have &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; mapped by NHibernate, so we need a way to tell the auto mapper to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those individuals from traditional XML mapping land, this is what we&amp;#8217;re going to be recreating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Person&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Id&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Int32&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;generator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;identity&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;FirstName&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;LastName&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/class&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Animal&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Id&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Int32&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;generator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;identity&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Species&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/class&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to initialise the NHibernate configuration, and supply it with any auto mappings we&amp;#8217;re going to create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Entities&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConnectionString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ApplicationConnectionString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddAutoMappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section is the configuration of Fluent NHibernate, which we&amp;#8217;re telling to map anything in the &lt;code&gt;Entities&lt;/code&gt; namespace from the assembly that contains our &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; base-class; then we configure NHibernate and inject our auto mappings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to run this now, we wouldn&amp;#8217;t get the mapping we desire. Fluent NHibernate would see &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; as an actual entity and map it with &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; as subclasses; this is not what we desire, so we need to modify our auto mapping configuration to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;code&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;entity&gt;() we need to alter the conventions that the auto mapper is using so it can identify our base-class.

``` csharp
var autoMappings = AutoPersistenceModel  
  .MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;entity&gt;()
  .WithConventions(convention =&amp;gt;
  {
    convention.IsBaseType =
      type =&amp;gt; type == typeof(Entity);
  })
  .Where(t =&amp;gt; t.Namespace == &quot;Entities&quot;);
```

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve added the &lt;code&gt;WithConventions&lt;/code&gt; call in which we replace the &lt;code&gt;IsBaseType&lt;/code&gt; convention with our own. This convention is used to identify whether a type is simply a base-type for abstraction purposes, or a legitimate storage requirement. In our case we&amp;#8217;ve set it to return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the type is an &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this change, we now get our desired mapping. &lt;code&gt;Entity&lt;/code&gt; is ignored as far is Fluent NHibernate is concerned, and all the properties (&lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; in our case) are treated as if they were on the specific subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basetype_as_an_inheritance_strategy&quot;&gt;Base-type as an inheritance strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;#8217;re going to do is create a simple model that we&amp;#8217;ll map as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/nhibernate/html/inheritance.html&quot;&gt;table-per-subclass&lt;/a&gt; inheritance strategy, which is the equivalent of the NHibernate &lt;code&gt;joined-subclass&lt;/code&gt; mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
namespace Entities
{
  public class Person
  {
    public virtual int Id { get; set; }
    public virtual string FirstName { get; set; }
    public virtual string LastName { get; set; }
  }

  public class Employee : Person
  {
    public virtual DateTime StartDate { get; set; }
  }

  public class Guest : Person
  {
    public virtual int GuestPassId { get; set; }
  }
}
```

&lt;p&gt;Relatively simple model here, we&amp;#8217;ve got an &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; class that defines the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; and name properties, then the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Guest&lt;/code&gt; subclass entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The XML equivalent is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

``` xml
&lt;class name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
  &lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot; type=&quot;Int32&quot;&gt;
    &lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/id&gt;
  
  &lt;property name=&quot;FirstName&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;LastName&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;joined-subclass name=&quot;Employee&quot;&gt;
    &lt;key column=&quot;PersonId&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;StartDate&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/joined-subclass&gt;
    
  &lt;joined-subclass name=&quot;Guest&quot;&gt;
    &lt;key column=&quot;PersonId&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;GuestPassId&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/joined-subclass&gt;
&lt;/class&gt;
```

&lt;p&gt;Again we configure NHibernate session factory to integrate with the auto mapping:&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
var autoMappings = AutoPersistenceModel  
  .MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;person&gt;()  
  .Where(t =&amp;gt; t.Namespace == &quot;Entities&quot;);  

var sessionFactory = new Configuration()  
  .AddProperty(ConnectionString, ApplicationConnectionString)  
  .AddAutoMappings(autoMappings)  
  .BuildSessionFactory();
```

&lt;p&gt;This is the same configuration that I used in the first example, except that if you recall the reason we had to change the last example was because it was mapping it as a joined-subclass - that&amp;#8217;s right, we don&amp;#8217;t need to do anything now! Our mapping is complete, Fluent NHibernate automatically assumes that any inherited classes (that haven&amp;#8217;t had their base-type excluded by the &lt;code&gt;IsBaseType&lt;/code&gt; convention) should be mapped as joined-subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s how to deal with base-classes with Fluent NHibernate&amp;#8217;s auto mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/person&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Auto Mapping Components</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-auto-mapping-components</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; The content in this post may be out of date, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Auto-mapping&quot;&gt;Auto Mapping&lt;/a&gt; page in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for the latest version.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just committed a change that should allow automatic mapping of simple components; by simple, I mean components that just map properties, nothing fancy. I&amp;#8217;ll be looking to expand this functionality in the future, but for the time being any kind of relationships aren&amp;#8217;t supported within components. With that in mind, I&amp;#8217;ll walk through how to automap your components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine this database structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address_Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address_Street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address_PostCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to map that to the following model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Domain&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Domain.Components&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PostCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this design, &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; is actually a component, which isn&amp;#8217;t a full entity, more of a way of providing a clean model to a normalised database structure. I&amp;#8217;ll get started by setting up the auto-mapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EndsWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Domain&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConnectionString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ApplicationConnectionString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddAutoMappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BuildSessionFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's our auto mappings integrated with NHibernate. Next we need to instruct the auto mapper in how to identify components; after the &lt;code&gt;Where&lt;/code&gt; call, we can add a call to &lt;code&gt;WithConvention&lt;/code&gt; which is where we'll give it a hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsComponentType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EndsWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Domain.Components&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;IsComponentType&lt;/code&gt; convention is what Fluent NHibernate uses to determine whether a type is one that will be mapped as a component, rather than a full entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things you need to know about this convention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only set this convention once, so you&amp;#8217;ll need to use it in a way that allows you to identify multiple component types with it; there are several options to this, including using the namespace (the above example), or checking a suffix on the type name (anything that ends in &amp;#8220;Component&amp;#8221;, for example).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This is not an exclusive call, so you need to segregate your component types from your standard entity types (so they&amp;#8217;ll be excluded by the &lt;code&gt;Where&lt;/code&gt; call), otherwise they&amp;#8217;ll be auto-mapped as full entities as well as components - &lt;em&gt;not good&lt;/em&gt;. I've done that in this example by separating components into their own namespace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, the &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt; should now be automatically mapped as a component; the auto mapper will pick up the three properties and map them as properties on the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s one more thing, for illustrative purposes I&amp;#8217;ve deliberately gone against Fluent NHibernate&amp;#8217;s inbuilt convention for naming columns. By default any columns mapped in a convention will be prefixed with their property name, so &lt;code&gt;person.HomeAddress.Street&lt;/code&gt; would be mapped against a column called &lt;code&gt;HomeAddressStreet&lt;/code&gt;; this is my personal preference, but not what our database contains! We can control how our columns are named by altering the &lt;code&gt;GetComponentColumnPrefix&lt;/code&gt; convention, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsComponentType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetComponentColumnPrefix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;_&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convention now specifies that columns should be named ComponentPropertyName_PropertyName, so &lt;code&gt;person.Address.Street&lt;/code&gt; is now correctly mapped against &lt;code&gt;Address_Street&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Update:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've updated this post to reflect some recent changes whereby the &lt;code&gt;GetComponentColumnPrefix&lt;/code&gt; convention was updated to use the component property instead of the component type. This is to allow for multiple component properties on an entity that are of the same type. If you still need to use the type you can access it through the &lt;code&gt;PropertyInfo&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Mapping private and protected properties</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-mapping-private-and-protected-properties</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; The content in this post may be out of date, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Fluent-mapping&quot;&gt;Fluent Mapping&lt;/a&gt; page in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's been a point of contention for some users of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning, and that&amp;#8217;s the lack of a method of mapping private and protected properties on their domain entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue stems from our use of lambda expressions for static reflection of your entities, one of the appealing properties of Fluent NHibernate; by utilising expressions we&amp;#8217;re able to protect your mappings from refactoring side-effects. However, lambda expressions can only reference properties that are public on an object, so that makes it difficult to use against protected or private properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the solutions we have are ideal, we&amp;#8217;ll be the first to admit that; but considering Fluent NHibernate was never designed to support these situations, and the limitations C# imposes on us, we&amp;#8217;ve got some pretty reasonable choices. Each option comes with it&amp;#8217;s own compromises, so it&amp;#8217;s important you pick the method that has the compromises you&amp;#8217;re more willing to accept; I&amp;#8217;ll outline the pros and cons of each approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nested_expression_exposition_class&quot;&gt;Nested expression exposition class&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Expressions&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ProductMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ClassMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ProductMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Expressions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option takes advantage of an interesting side effect of nested class scope and access modifiers. If you haven&amp;#8217;t done something like this before, basically nested classes can access their parent&amp;#8217;s private/protected members. We create a nested static class that exposes an &lt;code&gt;Expression&lt;/code&gt; for each hidden member. We can then use the expressions declared in this static class to reflect against the hidden members. It&amp;#8217;s reasonably clean, made even more so if you separate the &lt;code&gt;Expressions&lt;/code&gt; class into a partial class of your entity; so you could have &lt;code&gt;Product.cs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ProductExpressions.cs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refactoring friendly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mappings still readable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modification to entities required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need 3 classes to map an entity (entity, expression class, and mapping)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nested_mapping&quot;&gt;Nested mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ProductMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ClassMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ProductMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again using the scope trick, you can wrap your mapping inside your entity. This allows you to use the expressions as normal, without having to do any expression tricks. Like the expression class previously, this can be made neater by using partial classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refactoring friendly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can use normal expressions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modification to entities required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mapping nested in entity, so can&amp;#8217;t be separated across assemblies/namespaces&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reveal_and_string_names&quot;&gt;Reveal static class and string-based names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ProductMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ClassMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ProductMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Reveal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final option is different to the previous two, in that it utilises an expression generator to create an expression for a private or protected member. This is essentially what the first two are doing, just with strings instead of nesting tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No modifications to entities needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mappings and entity remain separate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potential renaming issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have the power, now pick the one that suits you best. Compile time safety, or entity purity? You&amp;#8217;re now free to make the decision, instead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think anyone on the Fluent NHibernate team is particularly happy with that we have to write these hacks, but we&amp;#8217;re doing the best with what we&amp;#8217;ve got. We all have different preferences, but at least there&amp;#8217;s something for everyone now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Auto Mapping Type Conventions</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-auto-mapping-type-conventions</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; The content in this post may be out of date, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Auto-mapping&quot;&gt;Auto Mapping&lt;/a&gt; page in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve already covered how to auto map a basic domain, as well as how to customise some of the conventions that the auto mapper uses. There are some more in-depth customisations you can do to the conventions that I&amp;#8217;ll cover now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re going to use the same domain as before, but with a few extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Shelf&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Products&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;mon&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sun&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve extended our domain with a &lt;code&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt;; the replenishment day is represented by a type-safe enum (using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javacamp.org/designPattern/enum.html&quot;&gt;type-safe enum pattern&lt;/a&gt;). Also there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;code&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt; against the &lt;code&gt;Shelf&lt;/code&gt; too (not sure why you&amp;#8217;d have a description of a shelf, but hey, that&amp;#8217;s customers for you). These changes are mapped against the following schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ProductId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RepOn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Shelf_FK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Shelf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ShelfId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you&amp;#8217;ve been following along you&amp;#8217;ll remember that we made all strings default to 250; and yet the new description columns are 2000 characters long. The customer has stipulated that all descriptions of anything in the domain will always be 2000 or less characters, so lets map that without affecting our other rule for strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddTypeConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DescriptionTypeConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DefaultStringLength&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// other conventions
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re using the Fluent NHibernate&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;ITypeConvention&lt;/code&gt; support now, which allows you to override the mapping of properties that have a specific type. The &lt;code&gt;AddTypeConvention&lt;/code&gt; method takes a &lt;code&gt;ITypeConvention&lt;/code&gt; instance and applies that to every property that gets mapped. Baring in mind that our convention in this case is for a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; property, and only for ones that are called &amp;#8220;Description&amp;#8221;, lets see how the &lt;code&gt;DescriptionTypeConvention&lt;/code&gt; is declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DescriptionTypeConvention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ITypeConvention&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CanHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AlterMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IProperty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;propertyMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;propertyMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;propertyMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithLengthOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s fairly expressive of what it does, but I&amp;#8217;ll cover it for completeness. The &lt;code&gt;ITypeConvention&lt;/code&gt; specifies two methods: &lt;code&gt;bool CanHandle(Type)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;void AlterMap(IProperty)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;CanHandle&lt;/code&gt; should be implemented to return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for types that you want this convention to deal with; this can be handled in any way you want, you could check the name, or it&amp;#8217;s ancestry, but in our case we just check whether it&amp;#8217;s a string. &lt;code&gt;AlterMap&lt;/code&gt; is where the bulk of the work happens; this method gets called for every property mapping that has a type that &lt;code&gt;CanHandle&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for. We&amp;#8217;ve implemented &lt;code&gt;AlterMap&lt;/code&gt; to firstly check if the property is called &amp;#8220;Description&amp;#8221; (if it isn&amp;#8217;t, we do nothing) and then alter the length of the property. Simple really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a simple implementation like this, we&amp;#8217;re able to map every Description property (that&amp;#8217;s a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) so that it has a length of 2000, all with an addition of only one line to our auto mapping configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iusertype_support&quot;&gt;IUserType support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other alteration to our domain was the addition of the &lt;code&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/code&gt;. There were two interesting things to consider for this change. Firstly, it&amp;#8217;s stored in an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; column, which obviously doesn&amp;#8217;t match our type; and secondly the column is called &lt;code&gt;RepOn&lt;/code&gt;, which we mustn&amp;#8217;t change. We&amp;#8217;re going to utilise NHibernate&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;IUserType&lt;/code&gt; to handle this column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of this example we&amp;#8217;re going to assume you&amp;#8217;ve got an &lt;code&gt;IUserType&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code&gt;ReplenishmentDayUserType&lt;/code&gt;, but as it&amp;#8217;s beyond the scope of this post I won&amp;#8217;t actually show the implementation as it can be quite lengthy. It&amp;#8217;s best to just assume that the &lt;code&gt;IUserType&lt;/code&gt; reads an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; from the database and can convert it to a &lt;code&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/code&gt; instance. There&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://intellect.dk/post/Implementing-custom-types-in-nHibernate.aspx&quot;&gt;nice example of implementing &lt;code&gt;IUserType&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://intellect.dk&quot;&gt;Jakob Andersen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we tell Fluent NHibernate to use an &lt;code&gt;IUserType&lt;/code&gt; instead of the specified type? Easy, with another &lt;code&gt;ITypeConvention&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddTypeConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DescriptionTypeConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AddTypeConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDayTypeConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DefaultStringLength&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// other conventions
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s how our new &lt;code&gt;ReplenishmentDayTypeConvention&lt;/code&gt; looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDayTypeConvention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ITypeConvention&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CanHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AlterMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IProperty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;propertyMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;propertyMapping&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomTypeIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ReplenishmentDayUserType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TheColumnNameIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;RepOn&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we handle any &lt;code&gt;ReplenishmentDay&lt;/code&gt; types, and then supply a &lt;code&gt;IUserType&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;CustomTypeIs&lt;t&gt;() method, and override the column name with &lt;code&gt;TheColumnNameIs(string)&lt;/code&gt;. Again, easy!

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s it, with those conventions we&amp;#8217;re able to keep our standard rule that all strings should be 250 characters or less, unless they&amp;#8217;re a Description, then they can be 2000 or less. Replenishment days use our type-safe enum, but are persisted to an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; in the database, which also has a custom column name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Auto Mapping Entity Conventions</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; The content in this post is out of date, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Auto-mapping&quot;&gt;Auto Mapping&lt;/a&gt; page in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post should be short and sweet. We want to alter our &lt;strong&gt;has many&lt;/strong&gt; relationship from &lt;code&gt;Shelf&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt; so that it has a cascade set on it. We don&amp;#8217;t want this to affect all one-to-many&amp;#8217;s in our domain, so we need to do this alteration only on the &lt;code&gt;Shelf&lt;/code&gt; entity rather than with an &lt;code&gt;ITypeConvention&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how exactly do you supply conventions only for a specific entity? Easy! with &lt;code&gt;ForTypesThatDeriveFrom&lt;t&gt;(ClassMap&lt;t&gt;).

``` csharp
autoMappings
  .WithConvention(convention =&amp;gt;
  {
    // our conventions
  })
  .ForTypesThatDeriveFrom&lt;shelf&gt;(map =&amp;gt;
  {
    map.HasMany&lt;product&gt;()
      .Cascade.All();
  });
```

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ForTypesThatDeriveFrom&lt;/code&gt; method takes a generic parameter that&amp;#8217;s the entity you want to customise. The parameter is an expression that allows you to alter the underlying &lt;code&gt;ClassMap&lt;t&gt; that is generated by the auto mapper. Anything you can do in the non-auto fluent mapping, you can do in this override. So for our case, we map a &lt;code&gt;HasMany&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt;, and specify it&amp;#8217;s cascade; this overrides the &lt;code&gt;HasMany&lt;/code&gt; that will have been generated by the auto mapper.

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it. We&amp;#8217;ve overridden the auto mapping explicitly for a specific type, while not affecting the general conventions of the system. You can do this for as many types as you need in your domain; however, baring in mind readability, it may sometimes be more appropriate to map entities explicitly using the standard fluent mapping if you find yourself overriding a lot of conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/product&gt;&lt;/shelf&gt;&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Auto Mapping Conventions</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-auto-mapping-conventions</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; The content in this post is out of date, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Auto-mapping&quot;&gt;Auto Mapping&lt;/a&gt; page in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of my previous &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/fluent-nhibernate-auto-mapping-introduction/&quot;&gt;Auto Mapping Introduction&lt;/a&gt; post, and is based on the same revision of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto mappings are generated based on a set of conventions, assumptions about your environment, that mean you can map your entire domain with a miniscule amount of code. Sometimes however, the conventions we supply are not to your liking, perhaps you&amp;#8217;re a control freak and want 100% control, or more likely you&amp;#8217;re working against an existing database that has it&amp;#8217;s own set of standards. You&amp;#8217;d still like to use the auto mapper, but can&amp;#8217;t because it maps your entities all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for you we&amp;#8217;ve thought about that, you can customise the conventions that the auto mapper uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What exactly is mapped using conventions?&lt;/strong&gt; As of &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/source/detail?r=190&quot;&gt;r190&lt;/a&gt;: Default lazy load, cacheability, string length, ids, key names, foreign key column names, table names, many-to-many table names, version column names, and a wealth of specific property, one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many overrides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we do allow you to customise a lot of things, not everything is covered yet. If you do encounter a scenario you can&amp;#8217;t handle, drop us a message on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, or even better: supply us a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll continue with our store example from before, which comprised of a &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Shelf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Shelf&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Products&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the standard auto mapping conventions, this assumes a database schema like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Shelf_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Shelf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too complicated there. The auto mapper has correctly assumed that our Ids are identity&amp;#8217;s and are primary keys, it&amp;#8217;s also assumed their names, the name of our foreign key to the &lt;code&gt;Shelf&lt;/code&gt; table (&lt;code&gt;ShelfId&lt;/code&gt;), and the length of our &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets assume for the sake of this post that you&amp;#8217;re not happy with that schema. You&amp;#8217;re one of those people that prefers to name their primary key after the table it&amp;#8217;s in, so our &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt; identity should be called &lt;code&gt;ProductId&lt;/code&gt;; also, you like your foreign key&amp;#8217;s to be explicitly named _FK, and your strings are always a bit longer than &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember this fellow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Storefront&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets update it to include some convention overrides. We&amp;#8217;ll start with the Id name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Storefront&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetPrimaryKeyNameFromType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we did there was use the &lt;code&gt;WithConvention&lt;/code&gt; method to customise the &lt;code&gt;Convention&lt;/code&gt; instance that the auto mapper uses. In this case we overwrote the &lt;code&gt;GetPrimaryKeyNameFromType&lt;/code&gt; function with our own lambda expression; as per our function, our primary key&amp;#8217;s will now be generated as &lt;code&gt;TypeNameId&lt;/code&gt;; which means our schema now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ProductId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Shelf_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Shelf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ShelfId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The convention functions are called against their respective mapping part for every generated entity, and the result of their execution is used to generate the mappings. The part that they work against is usually discernible from their name, or their parameters. &lt;code&gt;GetTableName&lt;/code&gt; for example works against an entity &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;GetVersionColumnName&lt;/code&gt; is called against every &lt;code&gt;PropertyInfo&lt;/code&gt; gleaned from your entities. &lt;em&gt;As there is no API documentation (as of writing), it&amp;#8217;s a matter of intellisense poking to find which conventions are applicable to what you want to override.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, our primary key&amp;#8217;s now have our desired naming convention. Lets do the other two together, as they&amp;#8217;re so simple; we&amp;#8217;ll override the foreign key naming, and change the default length for strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;autoMappings&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WithConvention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetPrimaryKeyNameFromType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetForeignKeyNameOfParent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_FK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DefaultStringLength&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all there is to it, when combined with the other conventions you can customise the mappings quite heavily while only adding a few lines to your auto mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our final schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ProductId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Shelf_FK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Shelf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ShelfId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time: how to apply your own type conventions that apply to all properties of a specific type in your domain, and how to utilise NHibernate&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;IUserType&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate: Auto Mapping Introduction</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-auto-mapping-introduction</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; The content in this post may be out of date, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Auto-mapping&quot;&gt;Auto Mapping&lt;/a&gt; page in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for the latest version.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; this was written against &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/source/detail?r=190&quot;&gt;r190&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;, so you need to be at least at that revision to follow along.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluent NHibernate has a concept called Auto Mapping, which is a mechanism for automatically mapping all your entities based on a set of conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto mapping utilises the principal of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_Configuration&quot;&gt;convention over configuration&lt;/a&gt;. Using this principal, the auto mapper inspects your entities and makes assumptions of what particular properties should be. Perhaps you have a property with the name of &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; and type of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, the auto mapping might (and will by default) decide that this is an auto-incrementing primary key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the auto mappings, you can map your entire domain with very little code, and certainly no XML. There are still scenarios where it may not be suitable to use the auto mapping, at which point it would be more appropriate to use the standard mapping; however, for most greenfield applications (and quite a few brownfield ones too) auto mapping will be more than capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with a simple example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it isn't the purpose of this post give an in-depth walkthrough of Auto Mapping, it's not out of scope for a simple example! So I'll go through how to map a simple domain using the Fluent NHibernate AutoMapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine what the entities might be like for a simple shop; in-fact, let me show you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Shelf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Products&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't get much simpler than that. We've got a product, with an auto-incrementing primary key called &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Price&lt;/code&gt;. The store has some shelves it fills with products, so there's a &lt;code&gt;Shelf&lt;/code&gt; entity, which has an &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; again, and a list of the &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt;s on it; the &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt; collection is a &lt;em&gt;one-to-many&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Has Many&lt;/em&gt; relationship to the &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m going to make the assumption here that you have &lt;em&gt;an existing NHibernate infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;, if you don’t then it’s best you consult a general NHibernate walkthrough before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise specified, any code samples are assumed to be placed with your NHibernate &lt;code&gt;SessionFactory&lt;/code&gt; initialisation code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're going to be using the &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt; to do our mapping. To begin with we should take a look at the static &lt;code&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;t&gt; method; this method takes a generic type parameter from which we determine which assembly to look in for mappable entities.

``` csharp
AutoPersistenceModel.MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;product&gt;();
```

&lt;p&gt;That's it, you've mapped your domain... Ok, there might be a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit more to do than that. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;t&gt; method creates an instance of an &lt;code&gt;AutoPersistenceModel&lt;/code&gt; that's tied to the assembly that &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt; is declared. No mappings are actually generated until you come to  your entities into NHibernate.

&lt;p&gt;A typical NHibernate setup looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
var sessionFactory = new Configuration()
  .AddProperty(ConnectionString, ApplicationConnectionString)
  .AddAssembly(typeof(Product).Assembly)
  .BuildSessionFactory();
```

&lt;p&gt;What we need to do is get our auto mappings in the middle of that.&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
var autoMappings = AutoPersistenceModel
  .MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;product&gt;();

var sessionFactory = new Configuration()
  .AddProperty(ConnectionString, ApplicationConnectionString)
  .AddAutoMappings(autoMappings)
  .BuildSessionFactory();
```

&lt;p&gt;Notice the substitution of &lt;code&gt;AddAssembly&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;AddAutoMappings&lt;/code&gt;. This allows us to stop NHibernate from looking for &lt;code&gt;hbm.xml&lt;/code&gt; files, and use our auto mapped entities instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt; If you're dealing with an existing system, it might not be feasible to completely replace your existing entities with auto mapped ones; in this scenario, you can leave the &lt;code&gt;AddAssembly&lt;/code&gt; call in there, and Fluent NHibernate will quite happily work with existing mappings.

&lt;p&gt;We're now capable of getting NHibernate to accept our auto mapped entities, there's just one more thing we need to deal with. The auto mapper doesn't know which classes are your entities, and which ones are your services (and everything else). The setup we're using above simply maps every class in your assembly as an entity, which isn't going to be very useful; so I'll introduce one final method: &lt;code&gt;Where(Func&amp;lt;Type, bool&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Where&lt;/code&gt; method takes a lambda expression which is used to limit types based on your own criteria. The most common usage is limiting based on a namespace, but you could also look at the type name, or anything else exposed on the &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
var autoMappings = AutoPersistenceModel
  .MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;product&gt;()
  .Where(t =&amp;gt; t.Namespace == &quot;Storefront.Entities&quot;);
```

&lt;p&gt;Bringing all that together leaves us with this NHibernate setup:&lt;/p&gt;

``` csharp
var autoMappings = AutoPersistenceModel
  .MapEntitiesFromAssemblyOf&lt;product&gt;()
  .Where(t =&amp;gt; t.Namespace == &quot;Storefront.Entities&quot;);

var sessionFactory = new Configuration()
  .AddProperty(ConnectionString, ApplicationConnectionString)
  .AddAutoMappings(autoMappings)
  .BuildSessionFactory();
```

&lt;p&gt;That's all there is to automatically mapping your domain entities. It's all a lot easier than writing out mappings, isn't it? There's much more to the auto mapping that I haven't covered here, and I hope to write about those soon. Until then, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/product&gt;&lt;/product&gt;&lt;/product&gt;&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/product&gt;&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The VB OSS debarkle</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/the-vb-oss-debarkle</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a discussion last night between myself, several others, and Roy Osherove, which Jeremy Miller &lt;a href=&quot;http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2009/01/07/a-challenge-to-the-vb-net-community-at-large-on-oss.aspx&quot;&gt;also commented on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was incorrectly stated. There isn’t a lack of OSS projects that VB programmers can use, there’s a wealth of projects out there. &lt;em&gt;I’ve personally used IoC containers, ORM tools, unit testing tools, and build automation tools in VB with my most recent employer.&lt;/em&gt; The issue is that more recent projects are using some language features of C# that the VB team hasn’t chose to implement. This has got Roy all up in arms because he feels that should be our problem (as the OSS developers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a side note&lt;/strong&gt;, it was also mentioned that there are few VB OSS developers because they don't have anything to cut their teeth on. Chicken and the egg, no VB OSS projects means no VB OSS developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that there are plenty of OSS projects out there that VBers can use kinda makes the argument that VB developers don't contribute to OSS because they don't have anything to start with redundant; the whole chicken and the egg argument is flawed because OSS is already out there. It has been out there for years and yet there are still precious little contributions from VB developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it all stems from a funny situation we’ve got ourselves into, one of unfounded expectations. C# and VB have always been pretty much the same language, just with different syntax. Everything you could do in C# you could do in VB. That’s no longer the case from .Net 3.5 onwards; however, it was only ever the case by coincidence due to their base in the CLI. If the CLI was never involved, they’d never have travelled the same path. When you take a step back and look at them for what they are, two completely distinct languages, this expectation for crossover appears less reasonable. I wouldn’t expect a Ruby developer to complain that they can’t use my C# project, so why should a VBer complain? VB is just as different a language as Ruby is to C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want a framework for Ruby, you'd pick a Ruby framework.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want a framework for C#, you'd pick a C# framework.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So why if you want a framework for VB, do you pick a C# framework?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the conversation...&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To those VB developers who responded with conspiracy:&lt;/strong&gt; there is no conspiracy. Nobody is developing with C# out of spite, we do it because it's our preferred language; nobody would accuse you of being spiteful if you chose to develop in VB, so don't accuse us of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To those VB developers that think we choose C# because it's the &quot;flavour of the week&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;versus the old workhorse of VB: that just shows how far behind you really are; if you genuinely believe the C# developers think it is en-vogue, then you're sorely mistaken. I don't think I know any C# developers that actually think C# is really awesome, just that it's their preferred of the two .Net languages.&lt;/p&gt;

I can't believe I fell for a C# vs. VB argument.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Fluent NHibernate SubClass syntax changes</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/fluent-nhibernate-subclass-syntax-changes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've just committed a breaking change to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; (as of &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/source/detail?r=184&quot; title=&quot;Revision 184&quot;&gt;r184&lt;/a&gt;), which I thought I'd document here for anyone interested; it's a reworking of the subclass syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping multiple subclasses with the same parent wasn't a very fluent affair, and it was pretty &lt;em&gt;wordy&lt;/em&gt; too. You can see a comparison of the old and new syntaxes below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Before&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;discriminator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;discriminator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IdentifiedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;bID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MapSubClassColumns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;discriminator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IdentifiedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;cID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MapSubClassColumns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;After&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much nicer! The changes you can see here are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;/code&gt; now assumes your discriminator is a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; if you don't specify a type&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;SubClass&lt;/code&gt; defaults to using the subclass type name as a discriminator value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IdentifiedBy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MapSubClassColumns&lt;/code&gt; are now merged into &lt;code&gt;SubClass&lt;/code&gt; as overloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nested subclasses were never really supported in Fluent NHibernate, but they were &lt;em&gt;hackable&lt;/em&gt;. You could abuse &lt;code&gt;DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;/code&gt; to let you trick it into creating nested classes. This worked but it led to some really ugly mapping code (and a nasty hack in the Fluent NHibernate codebase). I've given some loving to this area and have managed to really sweeten-up the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Before&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IdentifiedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;bID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MapSubClassColumns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IdentifiedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;cID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MapSubClassColumns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;After&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SubClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes in this one are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;SubClass&lt;/code&gt; can now be used within subclasses without having to reuse &lt;code&gt;DiscriminateSubClassesOnColumn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, these changes serve to make mapping subclasses in Fluent NHibernate a little bit neater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As requested, here are the domain entites that the above mappings represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Two subclasses with shared parent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BProperty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CProperty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Subclass of a subclass&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BProperty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CProperty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Waiting for change</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/waiting-for-change</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been in a job where “things are going to get better”, not just yet, but very soon. Perhaps you’re finally going to get a new product to work on, or that rewrite that’s well overdue, or a new development machine, or any number of other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you’re actually bothered by the non-arrival of your desired improvement, it’s very important that you set a cut-off date for it to occur by. Not only that, you also should define what action you’re going to take when that date arrives; typically, that’d be “leave”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a cut-off you can meander on, days turning to weeks, weeks to months, and months to years. Before you know it years have passed without any actual changes having occurred, only the constant dangling carrot of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not advocating that everyone quit their job just because they don’t get to do everything they want. This is about when you’ve done everything in your power to improve things, to instigate change, and when that still has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to know when something has become a lost cause, and when it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Tribute to Subversion</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/a-tribute-to-subversion</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: This is based on my personal experiences, and is not specifically “fact”. If your experiences differ, fine, but these are mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subversion has started receiving some more flak in certain circles, it’s no longer in-vogue, no longer cool. Distributed version control is the big thing now, Git, Mecurial, Bazaar etc. Well I’m a huge Git fan, and I’m finding myself slowly transitioning away from Subversion project by project. However, I think I need to address something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subversion radically changed how people perceive source control, certainly in the environments that I’ve introduced it into (primarily SourceSafe based). That’s no small feat, and I don’t think it should be forgotten amid all the hype around newer source control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attitude towards source control prior to Subversion was that of fear; it was a black box that you threw your code into at the end of every day. Nobody really understood what it does, or why it does it, and even in some cases why they’re actually doing it. This was probably down to poor user interfaces, but nobody really &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to use it, they just had to. It was never made a proper part of anyone’s workflow, apart from as a part of shutting down your machine at the end of the day (hopefully you remembered to do that!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then along came Subversion (sometimes with a bit of force), with it’s good tools, it’s stable repository, and it’s ease of management. You could host it through a webserver, everybody could access it via a URL. It never corrupts itself randomly, and it doesn’t require scary maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Subversion people stopped fearing source control, in fact they started enjoying it. People started deleting old code, entire swaths of code, because they were now happy that it was always going to be available. They actually made it a primary part of their workflow; multiple commits a day, regular history lookups, blame, branches, tags, the lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Subversion isn’t cool any more, but we shouldn’t forget what it did for many shops that adopted it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YaYAML: Yet another YAML parser</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/yayaml-yet-another-yaml-parser</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to make much ceremony around this, but I thought I’d mention it incase anybody else is interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of a project I’m working on I needed a simple file to store some data in, and I didn’t want it to be XML (for no reason other than the verbosity). I could have used my own format, but instead I’ve gone for &lt;a href=&quot;http://yaml.net&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve worked with Ruby on Rails at all, then you’ll be familiar with YAML. It’s a human readable (and writable) text format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I still needed to be able to parse my YAML document. There was a project announced 2 years ago to create a .Net parser, but like many things, it seems very much abandoned. So, after my &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/getting-started-with-ometa/&quot;&gt;recent adventure with OMeta#&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I’d hack on this too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-yayaml-yet-another-yaml-parser&quot;&gt;Introducing YaYAML: Yet another YAML parser.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get your hopes up, I’ve only implemented exactly what I needed out of the spec, which is very little indeed. However, it’s something I will carry on with when time permits. So what can you parse with YaYAML? Only documents containing a single flat sequence or mapping. &lt;strong&gt;No nesting, no multiple documents in a file, no variables.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to parse these two example files:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yaml
- a list
- of text
- strings
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;mapping&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;various&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;pairs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the source in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/yayaml&quot;&gt;YaYAML github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting started with OMeta#</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/getting-started-with-ometa</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a novice at OMeta, and as such, you shouldn’t take my advice as best-practice. This is based on my exploratory findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;String parsing is hard. I don’t think anyone will deny that. You can parse it by hand, you can use regular expressions, you can walk it character by character. With &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/sharpdiff-diff-parsing-in-net/&quot;&gt;SharpDiff&lt;/a&gt;, I needed to parse some serious text, it was in an expected format, but there are numerous rules surrounding it. I did not fancy parsing it by hand, or with regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered writing a parser for it, but dismissed that after my dealings with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antlr.org&quot;&gt;ANTLR&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio&quot;&gt;BooLangStudio&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not so much that ANTLR is bad, it’s just long winded; it’s completely &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern&quot;&gt;visitor&lt;/a&gt;tastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after 10 minutes down the path of parsing it myself, I cracked and decided to look into alternatives to ANTLR. I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/ometasharp&quot;&gt;OMeta#&lt;/a&gt; and (with a reassuring nudge by Jeffery Olson) I went with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-ometa&quot;&gt;So what is OMeta#?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it’s heart, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~awarth/ometa/&quot;&gt;OMeta&lt;/a&gt; is just a really great string parser, and OMeta# is a .Net implementation of it. Combine that with a fairly decent definition language and codegen’d parser creation, and you’re onto a winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows you to write a syntax grammar and parse content with it, without having to worry about lexing, tokenizing and all that jazz. You only need to learn one language, OMeta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on SharpDiff, I took a detour and implemented another very simple Git diff format. It’s a stat/metrics diff that just tells you which files have changed, and how many additions and removals have occurred in each. A pretty straight forward diff crying out to be used as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-basic-ometa-based-parser&quot;&gt;A basic OMeta-based parser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git has a diff format called stat (and it’s counter-part numstat, that we’ll be using). It produces output like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1    0    myFile.txt
3    1    anotherFile.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re following along at home, you’ll need to create yourself a new git repository. In there place a couple of text files, add some content to them and commit them. Then make some changes to those files, but don’t commit that. Now you can execute &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git --numstat&lt;/code&gt; to get the above output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Git documentation is a wonderful thing, and it provides us with a nice outline of the numstat output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1    2    README
3    1    arch/{i386 =&amp;gt; x86}/Makefile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, from left to right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of added lines;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a tab;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of deleted lines;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a tab;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pathname (possibly with rename/copy information);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a newline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the meat, there’s a couple of things we need to do. Firstly, (at the time of writing) there are no binaries available for OMeta#, so you’ll have to download the source and compile yourself. Once you’ve done that, you need to reference the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OMetaSharp.dll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OMetaSharp.OMetaCS.dll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to OMeta codegening our parser, it really needs to be built separately to our main project. If we don’t do that, we could get ourselves in a mess when we write an invalid grammar and generate some uncompiling code from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go over how to do this, but basically wrap the following code in a separate console app, changing the paths to point to where your code actually lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RebuildGitNumstatParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReadAllText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&quot;..\..\..\SharpDiff\Parsers\GitNumstatParser.ometacs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Grammars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseGrammarThenOptimizeThenTranslate&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OMetaParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OMetaOptimizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OMetaTranslator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Grammar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OptimizeGrammar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Trans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WriteAllText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&quot;..\..\..\SharpDiff\Parsers\GitNumstatParser.cs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That just gets OMeta to compile our grammar, then spit out a C# file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing, then we can get going. For this generation to work, we really need to give it a grammar and parser to begin with. So we’ll create an empty grammar and parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;OMetaSharp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ometa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;GitNumstatParser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;GitNumstatParser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can begin! One of the wonderful things about OMeta# is that it can be test driven very easily, which really surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets create our first test!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParsesNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this test, we pass the Parse function a generic type parameter (int) which is our expected return type, then a string and an expression. The string is our input content, and the expression is the grammar rule to use for parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also using a shortcut method for parsing, which you can see below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GitNumstatParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ruleFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Grammars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParseWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ruleFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run this test, it should pass. We didn’t do anything, I hear you say. That’s because we didn’t have to in this case. OMeta# comes with a few predefined rules that you can sometimes take advantage of (or override to give different meaning in your grammar). In this case, we’ve used the Number rule, which parses a string and returns an integer from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the next test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParsesAdditionsAndSubtractionValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;3\t8\tmyFile.txt\r\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Additions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subtractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a class to represent our file statistics, I’ve created one called FileStats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;additions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subtractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Additions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;additions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subtractions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subtractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Additions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subtractions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run this test, it will fail (and at the time of writing, fail with a nasty unhelpful OMeta exception). This is because we’re still trying to use the Number rule, so we need to create our FileStats rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up your ometacs file and follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;SharpDiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;FileStructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Numstat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;OMetaSharp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ometa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;GitNumstatParser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'\t'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, that’s a bit of an overload, so lets go through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line is made up from three parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rule name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pattern to match&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code to produce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this line, we’re creating a rule called &lt;code&gt;FileStats&lt;/code&gt;, which matches the &lt;code&gt;Number:adds '\t' Number:subs&lt;/code&gt; pattern, and produces the code &lt;code&gt;new FileStats(adds.As&lt;int&gt;(), subs.As&lt;int&gt;())&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;.&lt;/int&gt;&lt;/int&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets examine what the pattern is doing. Firstly, we’re using the Number rule that we used in our first test. The colon denotes an assignment to a variable, so we’re getting the match from the Number rule and putting that in an &lt;code&gt;adds&lt;/code&gt; variable. We then match a single tab character (‘\t’), and then another Number. Whitespace is ignored in the OMeta grammar, which means you can structure the file pretty much however you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pattern gives us two variables, adds and subs, we need to do something with them. The &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator designates the next curly brace surrounded region to be your desired C# code output. For this rule, we’re creating a new instance of our FileStats class, and passing our two variables into the constructor (converting them to ints at the same time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, run your side executable that recreates the generated parser. You should now be able to alter your test to use the FileStats rule instead of Number, and have it pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we parse now? We’re able to get the additions and subtractions from a line such as &lt;code&gt;1    4    myFile.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still need to be able to get the filename back though, so onto our next test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParsesFilename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;anotherFile.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;anotherFile.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This test won’t compile until we create our Filename rule, so off to the ometacs with us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;SharpDiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;FileStructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Numstat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;OMetaSharp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ometa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;GitNumstatParser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'\t'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LetterOrDigit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LetterOrDigit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ext&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now got an extra rule at the end of the file, Filename. I can’t stress this enough, &lt;strong&gt;watch your commas&lt;/strong&gt;; OMeta#s errors are poor, and something like that can trip you up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new rule looks complex, but is pretty simple. It uses the built-in LetterOrDigit rule, which matches a single letter or digit. We suffix that call with a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; which (like regex) matches one or more instances; that match is then stored in a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; variable. Following that is a single full-stop. Finally, another LetterOrDigit+, which matches our extension. We then concatenate those strings in our C# output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, recompile your parser. Now your test should pass. It simply matches any filename with an extension (room for improvement here!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can bring the two together, so we can parse a whole line. Next test!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParsesFullFileLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;3\t8\tmyFile.txt\r\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Additions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subtractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;myFile.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to update our FileStats class so it supports the filename.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;additions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subtractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Additions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;additions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subtractions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subtractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Additions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subtractions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our grammar file is going to undergo a bit of refactoring too. We’re covered by tests, so why shouldn’t we? Our &lt;code&gt;FileStats&lt;/code&gt; rule doesn’t really describe the whole line it should be matching. Really what we should have is a &lt;code&gt;LineStats&lt;/code&gt; (that’s what our FileStats currently is) that just matches the numbers, then a FileStats that matches the numbers &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the filename.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ometa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;GitNumstatParser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LineStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'\t'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;NewLine&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LineStats&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'\t'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LetterOrDigit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LetterOrDigit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ext&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;NewLine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'\r'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'\n'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we’ve done here is redo our FileStats rule as LineStats, which instead of creating an instance of the FileStats class, just returns an array of it’s two matches &lt;code&gt;{ adds, subs }&lt;/code&gt;; this encapsulates that particular bit of behavior. Next we’ve created our new FileStats rule, which calls our LineStats rule and captures the matches. It then matches a single tab, and the filename using our Filename rule, followed by a NewLine; these are then combined and pushed into the constructor for our FileStats class. We’ve defined NewLine at the end, and it simply matches the \r\n characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding and running that test should now give success. We’re now able to completely parse a diff line. Only one thing left to do, parse multiple lines together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CanParseMultipleLines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;3\t8\tfile.txt\r\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;5\t1\tanotherFile.txt\r\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FullFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;file.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Additions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subtractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;anotherFile.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Additions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Subtractions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EqualTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final test is a bit longer than the others, but it’s simple. We pass in some multiline input, and then assert that we have two FileStat objects, and that they’re correctly formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this test we’re using another helper method, which returns a list of rule matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GitNumstatParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ruleFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Grammars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParseWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ruleFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ToIEnumerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this test will fail because we haven’t defined the FullFile rule. So again to the ometacs file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FullFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FileStats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we do this time is add this rule to the top, which uses the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator to match multiple FileStats rules. They’re then returned as they are so we can convert them to an enumerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, recompile and run, you should now be parsing full diff outputs with ease!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see OMeta# is pretty easy, and it’s very easy to test drive. There are a few quirks to doing it that way (such as having to create the compiled grammar before your test will run), but it’s a lot smoother than I expected. The grammars are quite simple too, and there are some shortcuts you can take which help make things easier. The SharpDiff grammar currently stands at just 49 lines, and it’s capable of parsing 90% of the standard git output, not bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll just introduce you to another little bit of syntax that can make things simpler. Our Filename rule matches filenames with extensions, but it doesn’t match filenames without! That could be a problem; however, instead of creating a new rule for this, you can create multiple patterns for a rule. Each pattern will get evaluated if the one before it fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can update our Filename rule to the following, which tries to match a filename with an extension, and if it can’t do that, it then tries without an extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LetterOrDigit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LetterOrDigit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ext&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LetterOrDigit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;As&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Smart Indentation for Visual Studio Extensibility projects</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/smart-indentation-for-visual-studio-extensibility-projects</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I said previously in my &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/brace-matching-and-your-language-service/&quot;&gt;Brace Matching post&lt;/a&gt; that I want to try to document some of my findings while working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio&quot;&gt;BooLangStudio&lt;/a&gt;. Well this is my second post on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re implementing a custom language in Visual Studio, there’s a very good chance that you’re going to want to handle indentation slightly differently to the defaults. Every language has it’s own rules, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the resources I found online we’re pretty poor for how to get this working. Most people we’re pointing to overriding &lt;code&gt;OnCommand&lt;/code&gt; in your derived &lt;code&gt;Source&lt;/code&gt; class, or implementing some interop interface (i.e. &lt;code&gt;IVsLanguageLineIndent&lt;/code&gt;). I could get none of these working. &lt;code&gt;OnCommand&lt;/code&gt; never got raised, and the interfaces we’re useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a few different methods for handling indentation, but none of them worked very well. I tried capturing the enter key press, but that didn’t work. Then I tried capturing alterations to the document, but those also got fired for navigating the document, so you’d press the up key and add a new line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ended up being pretty simple to implement, once I finally found the correct way to do it. I’ll cover how I did this for BooLangStudio below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;LanguageService&lt;/code&gt;, there’s a method you can override called &lt;code&gt;CreateViewFilter&lt;/code&gt; which sets everything in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create yourself a class that derives from &lt;code&gt;ViewFilter&lt;/code&gt;, and then return an instance of it from the overridden &lt;code&gt;CreateViewFilter&lt;/code&gt; method in your language service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BooViewFilter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ViewFilter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BooViewFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CodeWindowManager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mgr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IVsTextView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mgr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ViewFilter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateViewFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CodeWindowManager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mgr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IVsTextView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BooViewFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mgr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You need to make sure your project is configured to use Smart Indentation. If your project is complete enough to allow the user to customise this, then you’re fine. However, if not you can hard code this value yourself. In your language service there’s a &lt;code&gt;GetLanguagePreferences&lt;/code&gt; method that returns all the preferences for your project. In that method you can set &lt;code&gt;languagePreferences.IndentStyle = IdentingStyle.Smart&lt;/code&gt;, which is what I’ve done in BooLangStudio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll kick yourself for how easy this is. Now override the &lt;code&gt;HandleSmartIndent&lt;/code&gt; method in your derived &lt;code&gt;ViewFilter&lt;/code&gt;. That’s it really, in there you can access the &lt;code&gt;Source&lt;/code&gt; object and do as you wish with smart indentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking BooLangStudio as an example, you can see in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/BooViewFilter.cs&quot;&gt;BooViewFilter.cs&lt;/a&gt; that I delegate the work to a &lt;code&gt;HandleSmartIndentAction&lt;/code&gt;. This is to make testing easier by having as little dependencies on Visual Studio as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Execute&lt;/code&gt; method of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/HandleSmartIndentAction.cs&quot;&gt;HandleSmartIndentAction.cs&lt;/a&gt; class gets the caret location and passes it to an instance of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/LineIndenter.cs&quot;&gt;LineIndenter&lt;/a&gt; class, which determines (based on the previous line to the caret) whether the next line should be indented, or outdented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetCaretPos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;indenter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;SetIndentationForNextLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-boo&quot;&gt;class MyClass:
  def MethodName(): # indent
    return # outdent
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s how to implement Smart Indentation in your Visual Studio Extensibility project, and a little bit of implementation details of BooLangStudio.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SharpDiff - Diff Parsing in .NET</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/sharpdiff-diff-parsing-in-net</link>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-sharpdiff&quot;&gt;About SharpDiff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SharpDiff is a library for parsing the output of various diffing tools. It’s primary purpose is to reduce the time spent by SCM UI developers in handing diff output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-sharpdiff&quot;&gt;Why SharpDiff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a few tools in mind that require parsing of diff files. I figure it’s a pretty common thing for SCM UI developers to have to do, so I thought i’d put it out for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parsing-your-first-diff&quot;&gt;Parsing your first diff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation is not concrete yet, but the current (easiest) way to parse a diff file is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;diffContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReadAllText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MyDiffFile.diff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Diff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateFrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;diffContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there you have a compiled version of your diff document. Intellisense will be your friend here, but basically you have a Chunks collection, and a Files collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff&quot;&gt;article on Diffs&lt;/a&gt; is worth a read if you’re interested. In short though, chunks are formed as a chunk header containing the affected lines, and the lines themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gh&quot;&gt;@@ -1,3 +1,6 @@
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;This is a small text file
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gi&quot;&gt;+that I quite like,
&lt;/span&gt; with a few lines of text
&lt;span class=&quot;gd&quot;&gt;-inside, nothing much.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chunk header is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@@ -1,3 +1,6 @@&lt;/code&gt;. The -1,3 describes the affected lines in the original file, the first number (ignoring the minus) is the start line, and the second number is the total of context lines plus subtraction lines. The second range (+1,6) is in the new file, and that starts on the first line, and has six affected lines; in this case it’s all the context lines plus all addition lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the other lines are the actual changes themselves. A line prefixed with a + is an addition line, a line prefixed with a - is a subtraction line, and lines prefixed with a space are context lines. Context lines are used for aligning the changes in the document. They’re also useful for determining if the document has changed since the diff was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of SharpDiff, your Chunks collection contains an instance of a Chunk for every part in the diff that resembles the above. Each chunk has the range info for the original and new file, and a Lines collection of each line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;early-days&quot;&gt;Early Days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; SharpDiff is still in early development. I wouldn’t recommend using it in production code yet, as the parser is severely limited, and there’s next to no error handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest flaw is that it only supports the standard git-diff output, and doesn’t handle many special circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standard git-diff header&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Index extended header&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chunk header&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chunk lines (added, removed, and contextual)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No newline at end of file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple chunks per diff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple diff per input string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other extended headers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Formats other than git-diff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As quick example of what you could use this library for, here’s a screenshot of a git-diff application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sharpdiff-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stupidly basic GUI&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Console colours wrapper</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/console-colours-wrapper</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing on from my post about an &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/alternative-to-abusing-using/&quot;&gt;alternative syntax for the non-disposable using statements&lt;/a&gt;, here’s a class I’ve been using lately. It serves as a wrapper around changing the colours in a console window. It’s not a difficult thing to do, it’s just a bit awkward because you have to maintain the original colour in a variable while you do your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Start...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;originalColour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ForegroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ForegroundColour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConsoleColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;WARNING!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ForegroundColour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;originalColour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not too bad when you’re only doing it once, but when you start swapping colours all over the place, then it can become very noisy. So this is where my class comes into play. Using the same syntax I described in my previous post, I’ve wrapped up the colour changing in a helper method that takes an Action delegate. This allows you to write much more intention revealing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConsoleColours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConsoleColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Different text&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this much cleaner and the blocks gives my console code some much needed separation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the full class code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ConsoleColours&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Foreground&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConsoleColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Action&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;original&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ForegroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ForegroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ForegroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;original&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConsoleColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Action&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;original&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BackgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BackgroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BackgroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;original&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Alternative to abusing using</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/alternative-to-abusing-using</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s been a bit of discussion of late about using statements, and how they’re more often being used for purposes other than just releasing resources. As always, there are those people who think it’s a flagrant abuse of a feature and shouldn’t be done, then there are those that like it. I’m in between. I do like what the using statement gives us, but I also think it is a bit of an abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “traditional” usage of the using statement can be found quite often in the land of files and streams. Take the following example, which opens a file and then closes it when it drops out of the using scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OpenRead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;myFile.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something with the file
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of the alternative usage can be found all over the place, but Rhino Mocks is one that’s close to my heart. Here’s from the record/replay syntax, anything in the scope of the using is recorded, and once it drops out of scope it’s no longer in record mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;123 Rester St&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I do like what the using statement gives us outside of releasing resources (I’m not disputing it’s usefulness there). However, I think the using keyword itself adds noise and clouds intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the adoption of 3.5, I’ve started using an alternative syntax instead of usings. Actions and anonymous methods to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something within this scope
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little bit more noisy in the compiler satisfying department, but because you have full control over naming, you can reveal intention more. No more unclear “using”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? Simple really, the method takes an Action delegate, which it the executes almost immediately. I say almost, because you can execute code before and after the execution. That gives you the benefits of the using statements wrapping ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Action&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something before
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something after
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OpenRead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;myFile.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something with the file
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;123 Rester St&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer this syntax over the using statement. Of course, it’s only valid for 3.5 projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Empty NHibernate logs and poor performance</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/empty-nhibernate-logs-and-poor-performance</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had an issue recently where NHibernate was performing very poorly on our production server, but not on our developer machines or our test server. I investigated the issue and narrowed it down to two symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptom 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Very poor performance. I’m talking 10+ seconds per page load, with no more than 5 queries being executed by NHibernate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptom 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Empty log files. None of our log files had any data in on the live server, but they did on our other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to investigate the second symptom first, as it may be causing the first (ends up it was).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I noticed that our logging was set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt;. Must’ve been a leftover from when we first deployed NHibernate, very sloppy, I know. So I reset that to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WARN&lt;/code&gt;, but it had no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When files aren’t being written to, you should always check the directory permissions. Low and behold, it was a permissions problem. Our test server had different users allowed to write to the Logs directory than our production server. I granted the same users access, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NETWORK SERVICE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IUSR_MACHINENAME&lt;/code&gt; in our case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I recycled the IIS worker processes, we were flying again. We’re back to having &amp;lt; 1sec page loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pure speculation, but what I believe was happening is this: Logging was set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt;, so it was logging &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. With each log call, the logger was failing to get write access to the files and throwing an exception, that exception would probably have propagated a bit too. The combination of the sheer amount of data being written to the log, and an exception per log call, were responsible for the severe slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short: Always make sure NHibernate has write access to its own log directory!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brace Matching and your Language Service</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/brace-matching-and-your-language-service</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to write up some of my experiences developing for Visual Studio while I’ve been working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio&quot;&gt;BooLangStudio&lt;/a&gt;, but I can never seem to find the time; either that, or when I can I’m not confident enough in what I’m doing to put it out here as a valid resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll start small, here’s a quick guide to how I’ve implemented brace matching using the managed Visual Studio extensibility SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What exactly is brace matching?&lt;/strong&gt; Brace matching is where paired characters are highlighted when one or the other is selected in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bracematching-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Brace matching&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things you need to consider when you implement brace matching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there are different types of braces that can be matched (depending on your language). Taking C# as an example, the brace matching works with parentheses (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;), box brackets (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;), braces (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), and chevrons (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). These all need to be paired independently, as to avoid matching an open parenthesis with a closing brace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the matching has to work bi-directionally. The user can place their caret at either side of the bracket pair, and the highlighting should know where both sides are regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;languageservice-implementation&quot;&gt;LanguageService implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the legwork of implementing a language in Visual Studio is done in the LanguageService, and brace matching is no exception. You should already have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ParseSource&lt;/code&gt; method in your LanguageService; this is where we’re going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ParseSource&lt;/code&gt; method has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ParseRequest&lt;/code&gt; parameter, which exposes a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/code&gt; property. When this property is set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MatchBraces&lt;/code&gt;, that’s when we need to do our processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AuthoringScope&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParseSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseReason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MatchBraces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// match braces here
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What needs to be done is pretty simple: Parse the open document and find the partner to the brace that the caret is on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In BooLangStudio I’ve implemented this in the following fashion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run the document through a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BracketPairFinder&lt;/code&gt;, which creates a list of bracket pairs in the document&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the index of the caret (baring in mind you have to translate between the Request’s Line and Column, and an actual string index)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the pair that the caret is positioned at&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the opposite bracket from the pair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the Line and Column of the opposite bracket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s up to you how you implement the above steps, as long as you end up with the opposite bracket to the one you started with. I’ll illustrate using the BooLangStudio source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AuthoringScope&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParseSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseReason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MatchBraces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// find all pairs
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bracketFinder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BracketPairFinder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bracketPairs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bracketFinder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FindPairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// get index of caret from source text
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;languageService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;indexOfCaret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPositionOfLineIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// find the partner to the bracket at the caret
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bracketPairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FindPartnerIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;indexOfCaret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// tell Visual Studio about the pair
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/code&gt; class has a helpful &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GetPositionOfLineIndex&lt;/code&gt; method, which translates between a Line and Column to a single string index. Very handy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got your indices, we need to inform Visual Studio of our findings. You do that by setting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;request.Sink.FoundMatchingBrace&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, then calling the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MatchPair&lt;/code&gt; method on the Sink. You need to pass two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TextSpan&lt;/code&gt; instances to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MatchPair&lt;/code&gt; method; the first is the left brace, and the second the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AuthoringScope&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParseSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParseReason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MatchBraces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// tell Visual Studio about the pair
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FoundMatchingBrace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nextLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nextCol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetLineIndexOfPosition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nextLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nextCol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MatchPair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TextSpan&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iStartLine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iEndLine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iStartIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iEndIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Col&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TextSpan&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iStartLine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nextLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iEndLine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nextLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iStartIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nextCol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iEndIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nextCol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AuthoringScope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// replace with your implementation
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/code&gt; class has another helpful method: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GetLineIndexOfPosition&lt;/code&gt; method, which translates back to Line and Column from a single string index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, just return an empty AuthoringScope, as it isn’t used as part of this parse request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! You should have now successfully implemented brace matching. You may need to tweak the TextSpan indexes depending on your parser implementation, but it shouldn’t be far wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;boolangstudio-implementation&quot;&gt;BooLangStudio implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in seeing how I handle the brace parsing, I may cover that in a future post. However, you can find all the source in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/master&quot;&gt;github BooLangStudio fork&lt;/a&gt;. Some interesting one’s in particular are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

Uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/54d4bcef79d4dbd2ff6cf1fbd9b0a15f325f5c41/Source/BooLangService/StringParsing/ExcludingStringLiteralsStringWalker.cs&quot;&gt;ExcludingStringLiteralsStringWalker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Basically, it lets you know whether it’s currently inside a bracket or string literal. Handy for not matching characters inside strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Time, time, time</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/time-time-time</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is a funny thing, a day can drag out and feel like an eternity, but a year can pass in a blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m about 8,395 days old today, that’s roughly 201,480 rotations of the hour hand of your clock. Remember how long it takes for that hour hand to drip by while you’re in yet another boring meeting? I’ve had over 201 thousand of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all equates to 23 years old, which isn’t too bad I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not often I talk about myself. I have a lot of opinions, but I generally keep me to myself. On this occasion I’m going to give myself a pat on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m pretty proud of myself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no qualifications, I have no A-levels, and only a few GCSEs. I am completely self-taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I’ve learnt is that only you know yourself. If somebody says you can’t do something, fuck them. Who are they to tell you what you can and can’t do? Prove them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told that programming is hard, and it’s not something you can learn in your bedroom any more. I was told I’d not be earning more than £14,000 by the time I was 20. I was told there was no chance I could get a job without any formal qualifications. Two jobs down the line, too many languages to list, and more money than sense - I think I proved them all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do for yourself is to learn how to learn. It’s the one thing they don’t teach you in school. Since I learnt how to learn, I’ve gained so much knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t concern yourself with the details, learn the techniques, learn the principals. It can be mistaken for arrogance, but I’m so confident in my ability to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;, that I can safely say that I can use &lt;strong&gt;any programming language&lt;/strong&gt;, any operating system, any technology, ever invented and ever to be invented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not scared of change, of new technologies, and I’m not afraid of being left behind. I can adapt, because I can learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a crazy ride so far, I look forward to what the next few years bring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Fluent NHibernate</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/introducing-fluent-nhibernate</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A couple of people have already covered this already, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.IAmNotMyself.com/2008/08/07/SkinningTheCatWithFluentNHibernate.aspx&quot;&gt;Bobby Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mhinze.com/fluent-nhibernate-project/&quot;&gt;Matt Hinze&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachariahyoung.com/zy/post/2008/08/fluent-nhibernate-for-creating-entity-mapping-files.aspx&quot;&gt;Zachariah Young&lt;/a&gt;. I figure I should say something on it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve adopted a project from &lt;a href=&quot;http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Miller&lt;/a&gt; that I think has the potential to be a really useful tool. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fluentnhibernate.org&quot;&gt;Fluent NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s primarily a fluent API for mapping classes with NHibernate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all well aware how awesome NHibernate is, but I think we all also have a bit of a dislike for the amount of XML you need to write to get your classes mapped; not only that, but also how the mappings are distinctly separate from the rest of your application. They’re often neglected and untested. One of the core tenets of the project is that we need a more succinct, readable, and testable way of writing your mappings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-api&quot;&gt;The API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the following simple hbm file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;hibernate-mapping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;namespace=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Eg&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;assembly=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Eg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Customer&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;table=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Customers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;ID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;generator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;identity&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Credit&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;bag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Products&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;table=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Products&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;column=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;CustomerID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;one-to-many&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Eg.Product, Eg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/bag&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Address&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Eg.Address, Eg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;AddressLine1&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;AddressLine2&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;CityName&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;CountryName&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/component&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/class&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/hibernate-mapping&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then compare it to the same mapping, created using the fluent API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ClassMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CustomerMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HasMany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AsBag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddressLine1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddressLine2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CityName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CountryName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you’ll note that there is a marginal reduction in lines of code, but that’s not what we’re particularly striving for. Instead we’re intent on reducing the verbosity and &lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt; of the code. This manifests itself in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_Configuration&quot;&gt;convention over configuration&lt;/a&gt; design for the API, where we choose the most common setups and use those as the default. For example with the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; element in the hbm file, you’re required to specify what the generator type is; however, in our fluent API we check the type of your identity property and decide what generator we should use. Int’s and longs default to identity, while GUIDs use the guid.comb generator. You can change these explicitly, but when you are using the default, it greatly reduces the verbosity of your mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testability&quot;&gt;Testability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one of our goals is to make your mappings more robust. I imagine most people have had the problem where you’ve renamed a property and not updated the mapping file; due to there being no compile time validation, the only way to catch these mistakes are at run time (hopefully you had tests to cover that!). With the way our API is designed, you use the actual properties on your classes to create the mapping, so there’s nothing to forget. If you rename a property, your IDE will either rename the property in the mapping, or fail at compilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to help you verify that your mappings are set up properly, not just syntactically valid. So to make your 	integration tests a bit easier, we’re providing an API for testing your mappings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;VerifyCustomerSaves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PersistenceSpecification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CheckProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;James Gregory&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CheckProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;VerifyTheMappings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes the &lt;code&gt;PersistenceSpecification&lt;/code&gt; creates an instance of your entity, then populates it with the values you specify through the &lt;code&gt;CheckProperty&lt;/code&gt; method. This entity is then saved to the database, then reloaded through a separate connection. The returned entity is then compared to the one originally saved, and any differences fail the test. It’s a fairly standard integration test, except we’ve taken the time to write all the wiring up that needs to be done, so you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-framework&quot;&gt;The Framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working towards our first official release, which will have a fairly solid implementation of the API. Once that’s out in the wild, we’re going to focus on our Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our framework is a layer that sits on-top of the API to provide an even better experience. We’re looking to integrate with your favorite container, which will reduce the code you need to write to integrate NHibernate into your system. Then we’re going to tackle extensible conventions, which will allow you to specify your own implied conventions for your application. For example, if you’re &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; going to call your identifier “ID”, then why should you have to specify it every time? &lt;em&gt;You shouldn’t!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development is progressing at a nice pace, and I expect we’ll be able to get our first release out within the next few weeks. The testing API hasn’t been kept quite as up to date as the main API, but we’re working on that too. It’s open-source, so suggestions and patches are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Latest on BooLangStudio</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/latest-on-boolangstudio</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I’ve written anything about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio&quot;&gt;BooLangStudio&lt;/a&gt;. Let me assure you that the development is still very much underway, and we’re steadily working towards our first release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fill you in a bit on what’s been going on. Jeffery Olson has completely rewritten the syntax highlighting to use the more flexible Boo.Pegs lexer, which allows us to overcome some of the obstacles we were facing with the traditional Boo lexer. There were limitations to what we could do with the traditional lexer, without modifying the Boo source. This was leading us down a road we weren’t keen on, one of maintaining a fork of the Boo source that contained our specific changes. With the move to the Boo.Pegs lexer, we’re free of this scenario!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bls-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Syntax highlighting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justnbusiness.com/&quot;&gt;Justin Chase&lt;/a&gt; has been tackling various issues all over the place. Several related to the build process, specifically how the Boo binaries are located on your machine, which has been a bit of a problem when there’s multiple developers working on a project whom both have Boo installed in a different location. He’s also been spiffing up the interface by adding some much needed icons to the projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bls-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Project view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinginstinct.com/&quot;&gt;Torkel Ödegaard&lt;/a&gt; has been working various issues throughout the project. He’s created a properties dialog for the project which allows you to alter the usual settings for your project, assembly name, default namespace etc… He also managed to get debugging working, which is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s me, I’ve been working on the intellisense capabilities. We’ve had intellisense support from day one, but it’s never been very extensive. For a long time it only worked on the current file you had open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire solution is now processed behind-the-scenes to provide intellisense. Import statements are now recognised and imported types appear in the local scope intellisense. Any assemblies or projects that are referenced have their top-level types and namespaces included in the intellisense too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally I’ve been working on improving the method suggestion logic, which was initially very flakey. It boils down to being able to transform the current line into the desired type, which can be difficult in certain cases (&lt;code&gt;StringBuilder().Append(&quot;Hello world&quot;).ToString().&lt;/code&gt; for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bls-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Code completion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that about covers what we’ve been upto lately. Our biggest problem currently is that most of these features are implemented in separate branches, and haven’t yet been merged into our central repository. We’re working on this, and I reckon once we’ve done that we’ll be looking at doing a release.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Missed out on something big</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/missed-out-on-something-big</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever get the feeling that you’ve missed out on something big? I never got to see Star Wars at the cinema. I missed out on the start of computers, the ASM, the BASIC hacking and what-not. I discovered most of my musical taste way after the bands were gone or going, so I never got to see them in show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of those are my fault, of course, because they were all before my time; in fact, most were at least a decade before me. That still doesn’t stop me from ocasionally getting the feeling that I missed out on something big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more. One that’s pertient to our industry: Smalltalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smalltalk is one of those languages, possibly the most prominent example, that has been idolised over time. It’s often touted as having an excellent programmer experience, properly object-oriented, the source of refactoring, great tools, and a solid virtual machine behind it. It’s one of those languages that people are proud to say they once worked with it. A language that people nosalgicly look back on. It’s also got an air of betamax about it (yeah, I missed that one too), people were sure it was better, but it still didn’t become mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We Smalltalkers used to think the advantages of our language were so significant that it would take over the world. We had a huge productivity advantage over C coders. Then C++ came along and gave C coders just enough to let them improve their productivity and their ability to write larger more complex systems. It still wasn’t as good as Smalltalk, but it was better than C, and much more accessible to most programmers than Smalltalk.” - &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/5/31/quick-railsconf-update&quot;&gt;Josh Susser&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/06/bit-of-history-and-interesting.html&quot;&gt;Raganwald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where am I going with this? Just like I can make myself feel a bit better by watching Star Wars on a large TV, or listening to the Rolling Stones live albums. I’d like to see what all the fuss was about with Smalltalk, by giving it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure where to start on this, or how long it’s going to take, or even when I’m going to do it; however, one day in the not too distant future I’m going to do some programming with Smalltalk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boo Visual Studio plugin progress</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/boo-visual-studio-plugin-progress</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick update on the &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/boo-visual-studio-plug-in-1-complete/&quot;&gt;Boo plugin I mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt;. Jeff Olson announced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio&quot;&gt;BooLangStudio&lt;/a&gt; project a couple of days after I announced mine, and we’ve decided to join forces. I’ve begun merging our codebases, and we’re looking to get a release out in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our combined code-bases have now got syntax highlighting, intellisense, single file and project support. Not bad going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now got a nice little team going as well, which is a big improvement from what was the one man band of my self. One of the contributors, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinginstinct.com/2008/05/boo-in-visual-studio.html&quot;&gt;Torkel Ödegaard&lt;/a&gt;, has written a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinginstinct.com/2008/05/boo-in-visual-studio.html&quot;&gt;nice overview&lt;/a&gt; of our progress and processes as-well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Freeing the model from its evil web-service oppressors</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/freeing-the-model-from-its-evil-web-service-oppressors</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current system I’m working with has a setup whereby the model (data access objects) are being used by the web-services for delivery; this means that the consumers of the web-services are directly tied to our inner implementation of our data access code. On-top of that, it’s old full of bad conventions, and is in need of refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my account of how I freed the model from the web-service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;vehicle_info&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_manufacturer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_manufactured_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_number_produced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the existing model. You can see that these have some nasty naming conventions that I just can’t live with anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large problem with pushing your model out to the web-service consumers is that I can’t refactor the classes without breaking their implementations; if I rename a field in my model, the consumers will have to update their code to deal with it. This is an issue because not all the consumers are able to update their code. So we’re stuck with how the classes were built years ago, with awful naming conventions, and no ability to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the ideal setup then? It’s my opinion that we should be using specialised DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for this purpose, they’ll exist solely to be the transport mechanism for the web-service. With DTOs you’re separating what your service pushes out from what you use internally, which allows you to refactor your internal design without any problems with integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;VehicleWebServiceDto&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_manufacturer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_manufactured_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_number_produced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an issue with using DTOs in an existing web-service environment, it’s unlikely your DTOs will be named the same as your original objects (if they do, you’re fine). We can’t just swap it out with a DTO, because the signatures won’t match in the WSDL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we change the web-service to return those DTOs instead of the original classes, we end up with this mismatch in the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vehicle_info&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vehicle_id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;int&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/vehicle_id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vehicle_name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;string&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/vehicle_name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	...

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VehicleWebServiceDto&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vehicle_id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;int&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/vehicle_id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vehicle_name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;string&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/vehicle_name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we get around this? Make the signatures match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can control the way objects are serialized by the web-service through the serialization attributes; namely the &lt;code&gt;XmlRoot&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SoapType&lt;/code&gt; attributes are the ones you’re looking for, these allow you to override what name is output in the xml for your class. Slap on those attributes, one for the standard HTTP usage and the other for SOAP, and give them your old class name; then as far as the consumers of the webservice can see, you’re giving them the same old classes. Now you have a separate DTO from your domain layer, but without breaking the schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the updated DTO objects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[XmlRoot(&quot;vehicle_info&quot;), SoapType(&quot;vehicle_info&quot;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;VehicleWebServiceDto&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_manufacturer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_manufactured_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vehicle_number_produced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which now produce this xml:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vehicle_info&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vehicle_id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;int&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/vehicle_id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vehicle_name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;string&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/vehicle_name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now free to refactor our code as much as we like, without affecting the output of the web-service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Vehicle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ManufacturingDetails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ManufacturingDetails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ManufacturingDetails&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Manufacturer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Manufacturer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ManufacturedDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NumberProduced&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Manufacturer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boo Visual Studio plug-in: 1% complete</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/boo-visual-studio-plug-in-1-complete</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do we want? &lt;em&gt;A Boo plug-in for Visual Studio&lt;/em&gt;. When do we want it? &lt;em&gt;Sooner, rather than later&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial aim of this plug-in is to provide a “good enough” experience when using Boo files within other projects. I’m not currently focussing on doing full-scale development with Boo; so the target is DSLs and Binsor. There won’t be any assemblies created, or anything else that would affect your project. The only difference between how you work now would be that you could write Boo using Visual Studio, with syntax highlighting and intellisense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s for the initial version anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that creating a plugin for Visual Studio isn’t that difficult, in-fact that’s an understatement, it’s stupidly easy. Most of the plugin architecture is successfully created using the project wizard, so there’s very little I needed to do from that point of view. The tricky part is getting Boo and Visual Studio to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by spending some time looking at the IronPython Studio implementation, the Boo implementation, abstract syntax trees, antlr, and after getting my head around what I needed to do, I set out on my adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the result? A very basic (and flakey) implementation of both syntax highlighting and intellisense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/booplugin-syntax.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boo Plugin syntax highlighting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlighter isn’t perfect yet. It suffers from slowdown when you’re writing an unclosed string, and it can’t handle multi-line statements yet (think comment blocks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/booplugin-codecomplete.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boo Plugin code completion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intellisense is pretty basic, it allows namespace navigation, and type methods, but there isn’t much in the way of constraints (you can see instance methods against types, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work to be done, but it’s fun and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;targets&quot;&gt;Targets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future I’d like to get the following done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make intellisense work with everything in the local scope&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make intellisense parse import statements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make syntax-highlighting correctly handle multi-line blocks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make syntax-highlighting highlight types (like C# does)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at some point tackle these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get Resharper involved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refactoring support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I’ll progress on these and report back in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is poor, it’s a mess and probably all wrong; however, you can get it in the usual place. However, I haven’t provided a direct download because it isn’t really in a state to be distributed yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source is accessible from Subversion at: http://jagregory.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/BooPlugin/ (using user jagregory-read-only)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plugin baby steps</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/plugin-baby-steps</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Making a Visual Studio 2008 plugin isn’t as hard as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making one that works is a bit more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting is fairly straight forward, just run a tokenizer over the text and colour code each token appropriately. It’s the code sense that is causing me to go slightly mad. To determine what methods need to be listed when the intellisesne pops up, you need to parse the code that’s in the document, then resolve any classes and references in there to build up a collection of methods to display. It gets more tricky when the document isn’t valid, because you can’t compile it. That’s where I am now, I need to figure out some way of partially compiling the document, or maybe using an AST walker.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Futility: Transforming entities into DTOs</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/futility-transforming-entities-into-dtos</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Future James: This is pretty much describing &lt;a href=&quot;http://automapper.codeplex.com/&quot;&gt;AutoMapper&lt;/a&gt;, just take a look at that instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quite dislike mapping DTOs to entities, it’s a pain, but mostly tedious and tiresome rather than difficult. I decided to try to ease things by creating a library that would resolve entity instances to their DTO counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My requirements were few but I was determined not to violate any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refactoring friendly. No strings for property names, changing names should give compiler errors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must simplify code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must improve maintainability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-attempt-explicit-mapping&quot;&gt;First attempt: Explicit mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DtoMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerDto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ... elsewhere ...
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerDto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a clever bit of DynamicProxy usage, this implementation successfully mapped properties on an entity to a DTO. I believed it was reasonably clear, but having to use mapper.Entity was a bit obtuse. Dealing with properties on instances without an instance is tricky, especially if you want to avoid using strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explicit mapping is very refactoring friendly. I could rename a property without breaking the mapping, so requirement 1 was satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CustomerDto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerAddress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the above code demonstrates, this implementation isn’t actually any simpler than just doing simple assignments, it’s in-fact more complicated because of the overhead of understanding what the mapper is. This simple assignment method is also refactoring friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with requirement 2 failed, and requirement 3 no different to doing it manually, it was time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-attempt-implicit-mapping&quot;&gt;Second attempt: Implicit mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DtoMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CreateImplicitMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerDto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ... elsewhere ...
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerDto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite implementation, it’s clean and smart; however, it’s also useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did the same as the first example, but implicitly mapped any properties that have the same name together. This is fine, but it would ignore anything that don’t have the same names. I could’ve implemented some logic for guessing names, but that would just be asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tragically this implementation wasn’t that refactoring friendly; you can rename properties, but it would silently stop mapping them unless you renamed it’s partner too. That’s pretty dangerous stuff. Requirement 1 failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does produce less code than the first implementation, and the simple assignment method, so 2 and 3 are covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-attempt-attributes&quot;&gt;Third attempt: Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CustomerDto&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DtoPartner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DtoPartner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Address&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerAddress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could live with this implementation, it’s not as clean as the implicit method, but it is still quite clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it fails in the refactoring test. You can’t rename a property on Customer without it breaking the mapping, because the property names are strings. Requirement 1 failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could smooth over this with an inspection unit test, which checks the strings against their types to see if the property exists, but that smells, it’s not a very good library if you have to verify it even works. I could’ve also created a static class to represent the Customer instance properties, but that’s more noise (you’d need 3 classes, instead of just 2); a pre-build step (ala SubSonic) came to mind, but that’s entering into the realm of diminished returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the obvious way is the best way. Old fashioned may be old, but that doesn’t make it wrong. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All about dependencies</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/all-about-dependencies</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This article serves as an introduction to the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html&quot;&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/a&gt;, and why you’d want to use it. It is not a getting started guide for using containers. If you’re interested in those, my personal preference is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.castleproject.org/container/&quot;&gt;Castle Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and you can find their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.castleproject.org/container/gettingstarted/index.html&quot;&gt;getting started guide here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are dependencies? Also referred to as couplings, dependencies are other modules that one module requires to fulfil it’s purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are dependencies bad? No, of course they’re not, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to create anything. However, highly coupled code can cause a lot of problems for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your code requires knowledge of how a dependency works, then your code is highly coupled. If your code is tied explicitly to an implementation, then your code is also highly coupled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ProductUpdater&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StoreChanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OpenConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CloseConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example is highly coupled to the &lt;code&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/code&gt;. Firstly, it directly creates an instance, which means there’s no way for us to replace that instance if we need to (I’ll come to why you’d want to do that in a bit). Secondly, it relies on a great deal of knowledge of &lt;code&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/code&gt;’s implementation. In this code we can see that you need to create a connection and open it before you can update the record; that’s quite a bit of implementation knowledge. If the &lt;code&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/code&gt; was to change so that the &lt;code&gt;OpenConnection&lt;/code&gt; method created a connection if one didn’t already exist, then we’d need to change every caller of  that code to remove the &lt;code&gt;CreateConnection&lt;/code&gt; call; in large system situations like that can quickly lead to a fear of change and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned directly creating an instance stops us from replacing it if need be.  Well when would you actually want to do this? For those unfamiliar with unit testing, you probably haven’t encountered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html&quot;&gt;test doubles&lt;/a&gt;; there are different types of test doubles, but for the purposes of this example they’re interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A test double serves as a swap-in replacement for one of your dependencies. These allow you to execute a piece of code under test, without having to worry about whether things are being put in your database, or e-mails sent for example. If your code is creating instances within methods, those instances cannot be replaced by a test double. Without that ability, testing becomes considerably more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tightly tying your code to an instance of a class reduces the flexibility and reuse of your code. Take the above example, that same code could be used to update the product in a cache instead of the database; similarly, you could use an in-memory storage instead of a database for when you’re running in a test or demo environment. If only your method wasn’t so tightly tied to the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is solved by using &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html&quot;&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/a&gt;, which is a part of the &amp;lt;a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle”Dependency Inversion Principal&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control&quot;&gt;Inversion of Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[DIP] seeks to “invert” the conventional notion that high level modules in software should depend upon the lower level modules. The principle states that high level or low level modules should not depend upon each other, instead they should depend upon abstractions. – Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, dependency injection allows you to stop instantiating your dependencies. Instead they’re “injected” into your object when it is instantiated itself. This allows the dependencies to be swapped out like we mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So taking the original example, here’s a version of it that’s been updated to use dependency injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ProductUpdater&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ProductUpdater&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StoreChanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OpenConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CloseConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above implementation now allows us to create a test double, and replace the &lt;code&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/code&gt; in our tests. As I mentioned before, we could now easily push in an in-memory implementation without any changes to the code required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can take this further though, because we’re still tied to a concrete class. Lets make &lt;code&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/code&gt; implement an interface, so we can create other implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IDataStore&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OpenConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CloseConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ProductUpdater&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IDataStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ProductUpdater&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IDataStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;StoreChanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OpenConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

	  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CloseConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our example is no longer specifically tied to a &lt;code&gt;SqlDataStore&lt;/code&gt;, so we could quite easily pass it a &lt;code&gt;FileSystemDataStore&lt;/code&gt;, or an &lt;code&gt;InMemoryDataStore&lt;/code&gt;, or anything else that implements &lt;code&gt;IDataStore&lt;/code&gt;. All that without having to touch a single line within the &lt;code&gt;ProductUpdater&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the power of dependency injection, and why you should stop hard-coding your dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Static method abuse</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/static-method-abuse</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I dislike static methods, there I said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everything, they have their place; but as the old analogy says, when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail. &lt;strong&gt;Static methods are being abused.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-make-me-instantiate&quot;&gt;Don’t make me instantiate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason programmers seem to be allergic to instantiating objects, to the point of where half the functionality is implemented in static classes and methods. You can go for days without seeing an instance in my current project’s code-base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s symptomatic of a bigger problem. If you think creating instances is wasteful, maybe you’re creating too many. You’re most likely violating the Single Responsibility Principal (SRP) or Separation of Concerns (SoC). Too many dependencies usually means your class is trying to do too much, get it spit-up, and get it clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;state-vs-stateless&quot;&gt;State vs. stateless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One justification for using static methods that is often touted around is that if a method doesn’t have any state, then it should be static. To me this is a fallacy, because state isn’t everything. Take the following repository example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-static-methods&quot;&gt;Using static methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FindByID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;102&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;James&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-an-instance&quot;&gt;Using an instance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FindByID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;102&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;James&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticably the first example is one line less than the second. However, it’s compromising readability in removing that line. Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;repos&lt;/code&gt; instance, you’re forced to fully-qualify every method call with &lt;code&gt;Repository&lt;customer&gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, which is introducing more noise per-line.&lt;/customer&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the methods &lt;code&gt;FindByID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt; don’t have any shared state, they both form a part of the encapsulation of data-access (in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a method forms a key part of an encapsulation, then it shouldn’t be static.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make the decision of creating a static method due to it being stateless, you’re revealing more implementation details than necessary. A big part of encapsulation is hiding implementation details from the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the methods are stateless, they might not always be that way; perhaps the repository could share a session between calls in the future. With an instance based design, you won’t have any problems. Try introducing state into a static method, and things either get very messy, or you end up converting everything to instances and having to rewrite any usages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Static methods tie you in at an early stage to a specific design, making it very difficult to refactor out later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-all-bad&quot;&gt;Not all bad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where are the good static methods? &lt;em&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; class is a good example&lt;/em&gt;. It contains a set of functions that are only loosely related (apart from being mathematical), that are guaranteed to be stateless, and most importantly are simple. Architecturally the methods in the &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; class could be applied to a wide swath of objects (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt; etc…) and to have them as instance methods would complicate the class hierarchy more than it would benefit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Static methods should be fire-and-forget, disposable, simple, and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;object-orientation&quot;&gt;Object-orientation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static methods aren’t associated with an object, they’re tied to a type. This is a big distinction. People are under the belief that because statics sit in the same class definition as instance methods, that it makes them object-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key points of object-oriented design that static methods violate are inheritance and polymorphism. The inability to substitute a method with an implementation in a derived class is pretty unforgivable, and heavily restricting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finally-testing&quot;&gt;Finally, testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument that you’re most likely to encounter against using static methods is that of testing. It’s certainly one that I agree with, I just didn’t want it to seem like that’s the main reason of my argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statics are bad for testing because they can’t be substituted easily. A major part of unit testing is being able to isolate what you’re testing from it’s dependencies; isolation allows you to verify one part of the system at a time. Static methods aren’t overridable in a sub-class, and so they aren’t mockable either (without the use of TypeMock).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two examples used above, in the first example it would be very hard to test that code without actually going to the database, because of the ties to the static methods. The second example could be refactored so the IRepository dependency is injected, and thus replaceable at test time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being able to test in isolation is the final nail in the coffin for static methods and me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plug-in's and browsers</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/plug-ins-and-browsers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeff Atwood (of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com&quot;&gt;Coding Horror&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/codinghorror/statuses/778279263&quot;&gt;tweeted earlier&lt;/a&gt;: “On Firefox: ‘add-ons aren’t a big draw for me – I just need a browser, not a circus.’”. I don’t know whether this was a quotation of himself, or someone else; but it’s something that I’ve heard mentioned before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because they’re there, doesn’t mean you have to install them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plug-in model in your browser allows you to install as many, or as few, plug-ins as you need. A lot of them are useless, but if there’s one that can boost your productivity, isn’t that worth it? I’d rather have a browser with a plug-in model, and one really useful plug-in, than a browser without both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prime example is FireBug, I couldn’t live without that plug-in. I feel stranded in IE or Safari when it comes to interrogating pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FireBug possibly highlights a hole in the developer support from the Firefox development team itself, but with a plug-in model you can fill that hole yourself rather than relying on their team; like we’ve had to do for years with Microsoft and Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/rant off&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>getfilename NAnt task</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/getfilename-nant-task</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my current quest to fully automate our build, I found my self needing the ability to copy a database backup from our remote server. The backup is in a folder along with several other backups, with a filename based on the date. I didn’t fancy trying to programmatically guess the filename, so I wrote an NAnt task to grab the newest file in a directory. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.geekdojo.net/rcase&quot;&gt;Richard Case&lt;/a&gt; for his overview of how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.geekdojo.net/rcase/archive/2005/01/06/5971.aspx&quot;&gt;create a custom NAnt task&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getfilename&lt;/code&gt; task simply gets the filename of a file in a directory, then pushes the name into the specified property. The filename to find can be based on the creation date, last modified date etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attributes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;format-table&quot;&gt;
	&lt;thead&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Attribute&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Required&lt;/th&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/thead&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;in&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;The directory to search&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;property&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;The property to push the filename into.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;searchPattern&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Wildcard search pattern for finding the file.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;of&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				The file to get the filename of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;NewestFile&lt;/strong&gt; - The most recently created file&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;OldestFile&lt;/strong&gt; - The oldest file in the directory&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;FirstModifiedFile&lt;/strong&gt; - The file with the oldest last modified date&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;LastModifiedFile&lt;/strong&gt; - The most recently modified file&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;FirstFile&lt;/strong&gt; - The first file in the directory, using default sorting&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;LastFile&lt;/strong&gt; - The last file in the directory, using default sorting&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;No - Defaults to NewestFile&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example usage is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;project&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Example&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;default=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;run&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;run&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;getfilename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;of=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;NewestFile&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;in=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;C:\path\to\backups&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;searchPattern=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;*.bak&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;filename&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;message=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Filename: ${filename}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/project&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreseeable usage situations revolve around anything where you’d need to get the last modified, or newest file in a directory; backups, database scripts etc…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing the filterable DeleGrid</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/introducing-the-filterable-delegrid</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The DeleGrid is a paged GridView control that handles data-binding through the use of events and delegates rather than with a traditional collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that you have full control over the data that is shown in the currently displayed page. Traditionally you’d retrieve the whole recordset then page it locally, but with the DeleGrid you can utilise your database/ORMs paging features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote myself from when I first &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/delegrid/&quot;&gt;introduced the DeleGrid&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[The DeleGrid] came about because I wanted a nice way of implementing paging using NHibernate without having the grid know about it. I really didn’t want NHibernate to leave my data layer, so I needed a nice way of the grid calling my DAL with the paging parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s new?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest change in version 1.1 is the introduction of filtering. The filter isn’t generated in some black-box fashion, instead it’s defined by the programmer. It’s built up from the columns in the grid, which define their own filtering behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filter acts upon any columns in the grid that implement the IFilterableField interface. Implementing this interface in your own fields is easy, so you’re quickly able to create custom filtering behavior for your grid. An example would be a date column, that has a date-picker as a filter control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fd-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Filter Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen not to implement the wealth of appearance customisations that are available in the normal templated controls. This is down to two reasons, firstly I don’t agree with it, appearance should be controlled solely through CSS. Secondly, there are so many, I couldn’t be bothered. So you’re only able to attach CSS classes to the buttons and cells, and specify the image urls for the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-example-implementation&quot;&gt;An example implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grid now has a companion project, it’s own data library. This separation is to keep you from having to reference System.Web in your data-layer. To use the DeleGrid in your project you’ll need to reference &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JAGregory.Controls.DeleGrid.dll&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JAGregory.Controls.Data.dll&lt;/code&gt; in your web project, then reference &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JAGregory.Controls.Data.dll&lt;/code&gt; in your data layer, if they’re separate projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to begin with, add the reference to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JAGregory.Controls.DeleGrid.dll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JAGregory.Controls.Data.dll&lt;/code&gt; into your web project. This will allow you to use the DeleGrid in your page. Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to reference the control in your page, you can either do this using a Register tag in your page, or in the web.config as so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pages&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;controls&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;tagPrefix=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;jag&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;namespace=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;JAGregory.Controls&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;assembly=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;JAGregory.Controls.DeleGrid&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/controls&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/pages&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in place, you can now put the DeleGrid into your page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-aspx-cs&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;jag:DeleGrid ID=&quot;grid&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; AllowFiltering=&quot;true&quot;
  AutoGenerateColumns=&quot;false&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;FilterStyle ToggleOnImageUrl=&quot;img/find.png&quot; ToggleOffImageUrl=&quot;img/find.png&quot;
      ExecuteImageUrl=&quot;img/go.png&quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Columns&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;jag:FilterableTextField HeaderText=&quot;Name&quot; DataField=&quot;Name&quot; /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;jag:FilterableBooleanField HeaderText=&quot;Active&quot; DataField=&quot;Active&quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Columns&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/jag:DeleGrid&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example I’m using a Customer object to bind against it, which simply has the Name and Active properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this grid we’ve set AllowFiltering to true, which enables the filter, then we’ve set AutoGenerateColumns to false so we can add our own custom columns. The two columns both implement the aforementioned IFilterableField interface, which allows them to define their own filtering behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also set the image urls so the buttons will be visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the page is set up, we need to get down to the binding. In your code-behind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// attach the events for requesting the data and totals
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TotalRecordCountRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid_TotalRecordCountRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PageDataRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid_PageDataRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsPostBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DataBind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’ve just done is attach the TotalRecordCountRequest and PageDataRequest handlers to the grid, which respectively fetch the total record count for the full grid, and fetch the current page of data from the database; the implementations are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;grid_PageDataRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PageDataRequestEventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CustomerRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// get the requested page of data from the database
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FindAllPaged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;grid_TotalRecordCountRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataRequestEventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomerRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CustomerRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// get the total records
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetAllCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html&quot;&gt;repository pattern&lt;/a&gt; to handle data-access. In the PageDataRequest handler we’re taking the range, sort, and filter info that the grid passed us and sending it off to the repository to get the data. Similarity the TotalRecordCountRequest handler does a similar thing but without the range or sort info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it really for using the DeleGrid, you just need to take the filter info and handle it using your specific ORM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repository-implementation&quot;&gt;Repository implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok I’ll throw you a bone, here’s the repository implementation to show how easy it is using NHibernate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CustomerRepository&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// Creates a NHibernate ICriteria based on the filters.
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// &amp;lt;param name=&quot;filters&quot;&amp;gt;Filters to apply.&amp;lt;/param&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// &amp;lt;returns&amp;gt;ICriteria&amp;lt;/returns&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ICriteria&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateFilteredCriteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FilterCriterionCollection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ICriteria&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;criteria&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SessionManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CurrentSession&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateCriteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// criterion handling - write this yourself depending on how your
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// db filters (and what filter types you're supporting)
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FilterCriterion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;criteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FieldName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;%&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;%&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CreateFilteredCriteria&lt;/code&gt; method is doing most of the leg work. It takes creates an NHibernate criteria, then adds any filter criterions to it. It iterates the filters collection, checking their type and adding the appropriate NHibernate criterion. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-example-project&quot;&gt;The example project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve attached a sample project that uses the grid to display a collection of customers that are paged and filtered. The example uses a SQLite database with NHibernate for data-access, I’ve done this to keep the extraneous code to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ObjectField 1.1</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/objectfield-11</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve updated the &lt;code&gt;ObjectField&lt;/code&gt; to be considerably simpler than it was before. While writing my &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/data-binding-hierarchical-objects/&quot;&gt;Data-binding hierarchical objects&lt;/a&gt; post I wrote this about the &lt;code&gt;BoundField&lt;/code&gt; implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Using a &lt;code&gt;TypeDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; to get the property… This strikes me as a bit odd to be honest, because the &lt;code&gt;DataBinder&lt;/code&gt; has the ability to evaluate a hierarchical path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is interesting, because I was using a &lt;code&gt;TypeDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; in my &lt;code&gt;ObjectField&lt;/code&gt; implementation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, the &lt;code&gt;ObjectField&lt;/code&gt; was using the method below to evaluate the hierarchical paths, which to be honest is a bit verbose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetNestedValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;properties&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PropertyDescriptor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;descriptor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TypeDescriptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
		
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;descriptor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AllowNulls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// no descriptor, and we're not allowing nulls so complain that
&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// we can't find the object
&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;HttpException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MissingFieldErrorMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;descriptor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// silently return, with the NullValue if present
&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NullValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
		
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;descriptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;GetNestedValue&lt;/code&gt; method was splitting the &lt;code&gt;DataField&lt;/code&gt; value and then recursively evaluating each property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the same implementation using the &lt;code&gt;DataBinder&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// looking to bind against child-objects
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataBinder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetDataItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controlContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataBinder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Eval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side effect of this change, the &lt;code&gt;ObjectField&lt;/code&gt; can now support everything regular data-binding does. So you can use indexers and such in your &lt;code&gt;DataField&lt;/code&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of other things you should know: the &lt;code&gt;AllowNulls&lt;/code&gt; property has been removed because it’s no longer supported, and the &lt;code&gt;NullValue&lt;/code&gt; field has also been removed because the &lt;code&gt;BoundField&lt;/code&gt; already supported it in the form of &lt;code&gt;NullDisplayText&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;downloads&quot;&gt;Downloads&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Data-binding hierarchical objects</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/data-binding-hierarchical-objects</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After my post about &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/objectfield/&quot;&gt;my ObjectField column&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I’d elaborate a bit on why it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re data binding against an object that isn’t flat (i.e. has properties that are more than simple types - namely classes), you are bound to encounter the following exception, which is caused by the &lt;code&gt;BoundField&lt;/code&gt; incorrectly handling a hierarchical object path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;A field or property with the name 'MySubObject.PropertyName' was not found on the selected data source.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this following Customer object for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ContactDetails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ContactDetails&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contactDetails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ContactDetails&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TelephoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;telephoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to just use &lt;code&gt;DataField=&quot;ContactDetails&quot;&lt;/code&gt; on a &lt;code&gt;BoundField&lt;/code&gt;, it would work fine because it’s binding against a property on your customer. However,  if you were to try to get the &lt;code&gt;TelephoneNumber&lt;/code&gt; property of the &lt;code&gt;ContactDetails&lt;/code&gt; by doing: &lt;code&gt;DataField=&quot;ContactDetails.TelephoneNumber&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, it would fail because the field can’t interpret the two property names; it treats the &lt;code&gt;DataField&lt;/code&gt; as one big name, which obviously isn’t correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;BoundField&lt;/code&gt; simply isn’t capable of resolving this kind of hierarchical path using late-binding. This is because it uses the DataField as the literal property name on the component, using a TypeDescriptor to get the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TypeDescriptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dataField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as a bit odd to be honest, because the &lt;code&gt;DataBinder&lt;/code&gt; has the ability to evaluate a hierarchical path. It’s pure speculation, but if this is a conscious decision it may be down to the performance implications of using late binding; however, I can’t see that it’s any worse than reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there isn’t a solution to this if you still want to use the &lt;code&gt;BoundField&lt;/code&gt;. If you don’t mind a bit of untidy mark-up, you can do this instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-aspx-cs&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;asp:TemplateField&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;%# Eval(&quot;ContactDetails.TelephoneNumber&quot;) %&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/asp:TemplateField&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty messy though, and you’re going to quadruple the markup for your columns; imagine having 10 of those, it’s going to get pretty ugly. My solution is to use the &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/objectfield/&quot;&gt;ObjectField I wrote about previously&lt;/a&gt;, which is a column that derives from &lt;code&gt;BoundField&lt;/code&gt; and overrides it’s binding mechanism, allowing it to correctly evaluate hierarchical paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ObjectField&lt;/code&gt; allows you to use the familiar markup from the &lt;code&gt;BoundField&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-aspx-cs&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;jag:ObjectField BoundField=&quot;ContactDetails.TelephoneNumber&quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully one of those solutions will suit you. Personally I’d prefer to see the &lt;code&gt;ObjectField&lt;/code&gt;, or other derived field, instead of the nasty &lt;code&gt;TemplateField&lt;/code&gt; usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a follow up to my ObjectField post, because a few people have been hitting that page in search of the exception, which it doesn’t really cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ObjectField - A GridView field</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/objectfield</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The version of the ObjectField that this post refers to is now out of date. Please go to the &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/objectfield-11/&quot;&gt;ObjectField 1.1&lt;/a&gt; post for the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered a problem while binding a complex object to a GridView, in that the BoundField doesn’t support specifying a nested value in it’s DataField property. So if you have a list of Customer’s, and want to display the TelephoneNumber property from inside the customer’s ContactDetails property, you’re out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-aspx-cs&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;asp:BoundField DataField=&quot;ContactDetails.TelephoneNumber&quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above would fall over with an exception along the lines of:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;A field or property with the name 'ContactDetails.TelephoneNumber' was not found on the selected data source.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a mind-boggling flaw in the BoundField, with the main solution being to create a nested GridView, which is just overkill for most situations. This problem especially rears it’s ugly head if you’re using an ORM layer such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhibernate.org/&quot;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subsonicproject.com&quot;&gt;SubSonic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have I done? I’ve just gone and created a solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing the ObjectField, a GridView field that allows binding against hierarchical structured objects. In short, it takes a BoundField and splits it on full-stops (periods!) using each element to find an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-aspx-cs&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;jag:ObjectField DataField=&quot;ContactDetails.TelephoneNumber&quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is now possible! Huzzah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;Extras&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one extra thing you should know about. The field has a couple of additional properties that can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is &lt;code&gt;AllowNulls&lt;/code&gt; which defaults to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, this will make the field return silently when a null is encountered anywhere along the object hierarchy; this can be useful if you know that there might be a null somewhere along the lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second property is &lt;code&gt;NullValue&lt;/code&gt;, which is displayed by the field when &lt;code&gt;AllowNulls&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and a null is encountered. Setting this value allows you to give a user-friendly message if a value is null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;downloads&quot;&gt;Downloads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ObjectField is open-source under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses&quot;&gt;new BSD License&lt;/a&gt;; read the license for what you’re allowed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NHibernate and the SqlTypeException</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/nhibernate-and-the-sqltypeexception</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhibernate.org&quot;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful piece of technology, I love it probably more than is reasonable for code. It does however, occasionally scare you with some seemingly odd behavior. I say seemingly, because every time I’ve had trouble it’s actually ended up being my own fault. &lt;em&gt;This is one of those times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture a simple page, with a &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/delegrid/&quot;&gt;DeleGrid&lt;/a&gt; control, being bound using NHiberate. Baring in mind how the DeleGrid works, two queries were being executed, one to return the first page of data and another to get the total row-count for the grid. &lt;em&gt;These queries were identical apart from the paging in one, and the projection in the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon execution of the second query, NHibernate was throwing a &lt;code&gt;SqlTypeException&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;SqlDateTime&lt;/code&gt; overflow. &lt;code&gt;SqlDateTime overflow. Must be between 1/1/1753 12:00:00 AM and 12/31/9999 11:59:59 PM&lt;/code&gt;. This was pretty bizarre. Why on earth would the first query succeed (and bring back records, fully populated), but the same query again would die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good place to start for NHibernate debugging is always the logs, so I delved in. I discovered NHibernate was attempting to execute an update statement just before it tried the second query. It just kept getting stranger, why would a straightforward query cause an update?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought i’d investigate why the update statement was failing first, then I’d tackle the problem of why it was even updating at all. Looking at the query I identified the column that was causing the exception, it was (as expected) a &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt; column that was trying to be set to &lt;code&gt;DateTime.MinValue&lt;/code&gt;. This exception is thrown because .Net and SQL Server have different ideas over what the minimum value for a &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt; should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why would this column be being set at all? Well, it ends up that the column in the database was nullable, but the property in the object wasn’t. So because &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt; is a value type and cannot be set to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, NHibernate was populating it with the closest value to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; as it could manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the key, as soon as I had that realisation, it was obvious what the problem was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NHibernate knew that the database had a nullable column, but it had to manage with the non-nullable field on the object. When it came to run the second query, it noticed that the property wasn’t null as the mapping file said it should be, so it determined the value must have changed. It then attempted to persist those changes before executing the query!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-break-it-down&quot;&gt;To break it down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nullable column pulled into a non-nullable field forces NHibernate to create the smallest value it can.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NHibernate then checks for any changes, expecting a &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; on that field but finding a value.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Object now considered dirty because value has allegedly changed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NHibernate performs an update before it pulls back the data agian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the fix was simply to make the &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt; in the object a &lt;code&gt;DateTime?&lt;/code&gt;, a nullable &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt;. That got rid of the false update, and fixed my queries. Simple when you know what the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the moral of the story is:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure everything is in sync - schema, mappings and POCOs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Percieved value and developer education</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/percieved-value-and-developer-education</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/12/12/my-pick-for-altnetconf-quote-of-the-day.aspx#171928&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/12/12/my-pick-for-altnetconf-quote-of-the-day.aspx&quot;&gt;post at Jeremy D. Miller’s blog&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye. To paraphrase, Jeff Tucker says that part of the problem of the lack of perceived value of ORM/TDD/IOC etc is down to the developers in question not having experienced the reason these tools exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He makes a fair point really, we use tools because they solve a problem for us, if we haven’t actually experienced what they’re solving then their value is appears to be much less than what it is. Similarly, the value of such tools and methodologies is nil when there is a lack of recognition of a problem even existing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t think the solution is to have developers learn “the hard way”. To discover the problem before using the solution is a problem in its-self. If we were to all learn from our own mistakes, and not from each-others, then we’re not going to make much progress as we’re all going to be solving the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people will have struggled with whatever problem has necessitated the creation of these tools/methodologies, so I think it’s more a case of helping the developers connect the dots; “You remember such and such a problem? Well that’s easily solved using methodology/technology x!”, rather than making them retrace the steps of every developer before them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On testing implementation</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/on-testing-implementation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve found my-self in the situation of retro-fitting a library of code with unit tests, not a good situation to be in. However, what’s more concerning is I’ve just caught my-self writing tests that are heavily testing the implementation of a method; rather than simply testing if the method does what it’s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few problems with falling into this trap. Firstly, it’s very brittle. Secondly, you shouldn’t be concerned with the internals. Thirdly, it’s very time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s brittle because you’re essentially writing a script of how the method is going to execute, which of course will change whenever you do any refactoring. So your tests break every time you make a change to your code, which is not only annoying, but will quickly lead to &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCancer.html&quot;&gt;test cancer&lt;/a&gt;, where tests aren’t run or are commented out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t be concerned with the internals, because as long as your method is doing as requested, you shouldn’t really care how it’s achieving it’s goal. Not bolting down the internals allows methods to be refactored without too much resistance from the tests. This will increase the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing failing tests to be representative of a problem greater than your basic refactorings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s time consuming simply because you’re duplicating most of your work. All the time you spent writing the method (or the test, if done first) is then duplicated writing the tests (or code…). This is a pain, because as mentioned above, you’ll keep doing this work every time you change the method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part is learning how to not do this kind thing blindly. There are plenty of times when you’ll need this kind of testing, but don’t make it your default! Test expectations, not implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DeleGrid - a paged GridView control</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/delegrid</link>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-the-delegrid&quot;&gt;Introducing the DeleGrid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DeleGrid is a control derived from the ASP.Net GridView, that delegates its data retrieval back out of the control. This allows the developer full control over the records that are retrieved, thus allowing proper paging to be implemented using whatever collection type you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-delegrid&quot;&gt;Why the DeleGrid?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came about because I wanted a nice way of implementing paging using NHibernate without having the grid know about it. I really didn’t want NHibernate to leave my data layer, so I needed a nice way of the grid calling my DAL with the paging parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to utilise the ObjectDataSource because honestly, it made me feel dirty. I’m all for delegation and composition, but not when it means creating a control in my HTML that acts as a DAL. Additionally, I didn’t feel the ObjectDataSource was very type-safe, or refactor-friendly, with the method names and types exposed in the HTML. Granted, the IDE would probably pick it up, but I don’t want to risk a runtime failure on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-the-delegrid-aka-the-example&quot;&gt;Using the DeleGrid (aka The Example)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting the source or assembly and doing the usual song-and-dance, add a reference to the control to your page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-aspx-cs&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;%@ Register Assembly=&quot;JAGregory.Controls.DeleGrid&quot; Namespace=&quot;JAGregory.Controls&quot; TagPrefix=&quot;jag&quot; %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then create an instance of the control, turning the paging on and setting the correct page size:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-aspx-cs&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;jag:DeleGrid ID=&quot;grid&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; AllowPaging=&quot;true&quot; PageSize=&quot;4&quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have a control set up, however it sill won’t bind correctly. So, you need to attach the event handlers in the code-behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eventArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eventArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TotalRecordCountRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// code to get total
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the TotalRecordCountRequest, this event is raised when the grid needs to know how many records in total your grid is going to be displaying. This number is the cumulative count of all the pages. I’m going to use a simple repository pattern to factor away my DAL logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OnInit method is now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eventArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eventArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ProductRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ProductRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TotalRecordCountRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetTotal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your grid knows how many records it has overall, however we still haven’t told it how to actually get the data. So now to put the code in the PageDataRequest handler. This event is raised when the grid is needing a new page of data, this will get called once on initial data-bind, then again every time you change the page (or sorting etc…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OnInit method is now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eventArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eventArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ProductRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ProductRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TotalRecordCountRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetTotal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PageDataRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delegate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DataRequestEventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event-handler receives an instance of DataRequestEventArgs, which contains the start index of the current page of data, and the number of records in a page. It also contains a SortField and SortDirection, for when sorting is enabled on the grid; however, we aren’t utilising them in this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we just need to bind the grid on page load. We don’t re-bind the grid on post-back, due to that being handled internally in the DeleGrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EventArgs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eventArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;OnLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eventArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IsPostBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DataBind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all there is to it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to use delegates, the normal event-handler syntax is fine (and probably preferred for larger examples). I just did it this way for brevity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-reading&quot;&gt;Further reading…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written a small number of tests that cover the implementation of the grid as best I can. There was only so-far I was willing to go to test the control, as it’s heavily tied to the ASP.Net implementation; which can get pretty messy for testing without using something like NUnitASP, which was a bit much for one control.. I’ve got coverage of about 85% of the code, which I’d say is pretty reasonable anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sorting&quot;&gt;Sorting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, you can implement sorting in your handlers by accessing the SortField and SortDirection properties of the event arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delegridalwaysrequesttotal&quot;&gt;DeleGrid.AlwaysRequestTotal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default the DeleGrid only requests the total number of records on the initial data-bind, however if you see this as being a problem (such as with rapidly changing data-sets), you may want to set this property to true so it refreshes the total on every data-bind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;downloads&quot;&gt;Downloads&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing this as a comment, but I felt it’s own post was deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rickyclarkson.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Ricky Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; left me a link in a comment to one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://rickyclarkson.blogspot.com/2007/05/you-dont-need-tdd-you-need-repl.html&quot;&gt;his posts&lt;/a&gt; that ties in quite nicely to my recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jagregory.com/2007/07/17/getting-with-it-test-driven-development/&quot;&gt;Getting with it: Test Driven Development&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricky makes the point that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/span&gt; can be dangerous, and can lull you into a false sense of security. &lt;em&gt;I agree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any technology, when used incorrectly it can cause more damage than not using it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricky’s example should serve as a double-barreled warning. You can’t be test-driven only when it’s convenient, and you need to have good test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-test-driven-isnt-being-convenience-driven&quot;&gt;Being Test-Driven isn’t being Convenience-Driven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by being in a car with seat-belts doesn’t mean they’ll save you when you crash, you need to actually wear them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t pick and choose which parts of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/span&gt; you want to use, then be surprised when it lets you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your boss comes storming in demanding a copy of the system, tell him to wait. Remember, it’s your hide on the line, if you give him a broken system you’ll be the one to pay. If he doesn’t understand testing, lie, tell him it’s building or something similar, it doesn’t exist until it’s finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;test-coverage&quot;&gt;Test coverage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s very little more important than good test coverage, without it you’re leaving yourself wide open for problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ricky’s example, he’s fallen into a common problem with test design. &lt;em&gt;He’s only testing the expected outcome of his method.&lt;/em&gt; We’ve all fallen into this trap at some point, but it’s a dangerous place to be. Without full coverage, just as Ricky said, you end up with a false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For full test coverage of a method, you really need to test it’s expected outcome, how it handles edge-cases, and how it handles bad data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;point+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;999&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;987&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;789&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;998&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1788&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1985&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had Ricky’s test suite included the above edge-case test, it would have caught the flaw in his method’s design, and been able to correct it. A few more like the above, to cover minus numbers and very low values, and his situation would have been greatly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a way you can improve testing, it’s to write more unit tests. Only leave those bits you really can’t test to integration. Everything else should be adequately covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-parting&quot;&gt;In parting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, using &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/span&gt; isn’t an excuse to leave your common sense at the door. If you’re writing a method which you know is going to be used in several places, test those several places, give it very good coverage. If you’re writing a sum function like Ricky, you know how it’s going to be used, don’t just write if statements to cover all your input data, that’s using coding to make a test pass an excuse to write bad code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applying a bit of XP to hobby projects</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/applying-a-bit-of-xp-to-hobby-projects</link>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hobby projects, everybody has one or two on the go. They&amp;amp;#8217;re fun little side-steps from the mundane routine of developing for a living. These projects usually get a fair bit of thought put into them, but precious little time&amp;amp;#8212;an unfortunate side-effect of having a life outside work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We&amp;amp;#8217;re all used to working within limited time-frames, but the limitations are much more noticeable when you only have a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. This time is precious, but unfortunately we often find ourselves spending the time doing much less than we would like. That might be because you&amp;amp;#8217;ve hit a design aspect you can&amp;amp;#8217;t solve yet, or more often because your time is spent flitting between tasks. This lack of visible progress has a demoralising effect, next time you get some free time you may be less inclined to spend it on your project because you know you&amp;amp;#8217;ll not make much headway.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After spending what few spare minutes I have (aka. toilet breaks) reading &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xprogramming.com/&quot;&amp;gt;Ron Jeffries&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8217; book &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0735619492?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;#38;tag=jamegreg-21&amp;amp;#38;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;#38;camp=1634&amp;amp;#38;creative=6738&amp;amp;#38;creativeASIN=0735619492&quot;&amp;gt;Extreme Programming Adventures in C#&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;, which by-the-way is an excellent read, one aspect stood out that might help reduce the feeling of futility. It&amp;amp;#8217;s a concept called User Stories&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;#xp-hobby-fn1&quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A User Story is a short description of the behavior of the system from the point of view of the Customer. They are in the format of about three sentences of text written in the Customer’s terminology without technical jargon. In simplistic terms, user stories are the response to, &amp;amp;#8220;Tell me the stories of what the system will do. Write down the name of the story and a paragraph or two.&amp;amp;#8221;  &amp;amp;#8212;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayford.ca/xp/stories.html&quot;&amp;gt;XP Practices &amp;amp;#8211; User Stories&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, Mayford Technologies&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These stories describe how the customer wants the system to work, in manageable chunks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples would be:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After adding a new product, we should be shown the inventory with our new product highlighted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When removing a product from the inventory a reason for the deletion should be supplied by the user, then an e-mail should be sent to the person who added the product with this reason.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Actions should be recorded, so on startup the most commonly used actions can be presented for quick access.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By hijacking this concept, we can improve our morale by giving us some feeling of progress in our project. Next time you&amp;amp;#8217;re daydreaming about your hobby project, break down your thoughts and write little stories about the functionality, nothing more than a couple of sentences. Once you&amp;amp;#8217;ve got a few stories together, prioritise the stories in whatever fashion suits you best.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Armed with your collection of stories, the next time you sit down for some hobby time, focus only on the first story. When your time is up, if you&amp;amp;#8217;ve managed to complete the story, cross it off the list. Then when you&amp;amp;#8217;re wrapping up, take a look at that list, doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t it feel nice to actually see some progress? You&amp;amp;#8217;ve reduced your list by one. That&amp;amp;#8217;s substantially more noticeable than just the buckshot effect we&amp;amp;#8217;re used to. You&amp;amp;#8217;ve actually implemented a new feature!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you repeat this process whenever you get to do some development, you&amp;amp;#8217;ll start making some very visible progress, which is certainly a good feeling. I&amp;amp;#8217;ve found that this feeling makes me want to spend more time developing, definitely an improvement over the common feelings of futility.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Give it a try, see how it suits you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;p id=&quot;xp-hobby-fn1&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/userstories.html&quot;&amp;gt;User Stories&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, ExtremeProgramming.org&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Getting with it: Test-Driven Development</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/getting-with-it-test-driven-development</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Test-driven development is a practice that has started to make some serious headway into the average developer world of .Net. The tools have reached a stage of maturity where they offer solutions to most (if not all) aspects of test-driven development. Alongside the improved tools there has been a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of articles addressing the needs of new and established test-driven developers. The combined effect of this is of a reduced learning curve for the average developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, test-driven development is something I should have started doing a long time ago, it’s certainly something that I’ve known about long-enough to be unable to claim ignorance. I take no pride in saying that my sole reason for not learning sooner is laziness. I bet I’m not the only one though. There’s a lot to learn, and not all of it is simply new tools, some of it is mental too; rewiring your brain isn’t an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having broke through the pain barrier, I can now vouch for the other side and say it really is nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how would I convince my-self from six months ago, that test-driven development is a worthwhile pursuit? Well after a bit of ear twisting about being lazy, I’d have to raise the point of security. I don’t mean the “IM &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IN UR HARD DRIVE&lt;/span&gt;, STEALIN &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UR FILEZ&lt;/span&gt;” security, but the knowledge that you’re the one who’ll find bugs in your code, not the tester (or worse, the customer). A record of bugless (or bug-minimal) releases will bode well at your performance reviews. That, and nobody likes people finding problems in their code, so it’s best you find them first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all sounds rather selfish and egotistical. What about the team, the flexibility, and the clean structured code-base? I’m a big advocate of a clean code-base, and a well oiled team can’t be beat, but from experience, not everybody else feels the same way. Developers tend to respond more readily to two things: money, and fun. I’m generalising of course, but your average-joe developer isn’t an altruist, he isn’t going to go out of his way to help others. Give him the prospect of some extra cash, or even just the chance to break out of the mundane, and it’s a whole different game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the turning point for me, where test-driven development past the point of being a nice-to-have practice and entered the territory of being something that could benefit me in my daily life. I also discovered it’s pretty fun too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Test-Driven Development = Security in code = Security in your job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;N.B. I shall not be held responsible for anyone who still proceeds to lose their job, even while practicing test-driven development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing that I haven’t mentioned. There’s a feeling. A feeling of joy, a reassuring warmth. You get this feeling often when you’re test-driven. Found a bug? Write a test. Test fails. Fix the bug. Test passes. You’ve fixed the bug; knowledge, safety, and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-to-drive&quot;&gt;Learning to drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When learning how to test drive your development, it’s important to know that you aren’t specifically learning a new tool as many people have put it. Not in the same respect as learning a new &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; or source control system. Test-driven development isn’t something physical. As I mentioned earlier, it requires you to rewire your programming brain. Although to successfully master test-driven development you are required to learn some physical tools (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nunit.org/&quot;&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt; for example), the primary change will be a&lt;br /&gt;
mental one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most basic changes to your mental-model will be that your tests literally drive your code. You’ve probably heard it before, but you test first&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is a simple run-through of how you’d test-drive some simple development, and how changes to a system would be handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to keep the code as terse as possible, as to not complicate the theory with execution. There will be some boilerplate code that I will not include, such as setting up the fixtures. &lt;a href=&quot;http://xprogramming.com&quot;&gt;Ron Jeffries&lt;/a&gt; provides a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/acsUsingNUnit.htm&quot;&gt;good introduction to NUnit&lt;/a&gt; for .Net developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-first-iteration&quot;&gt;The First Iteration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set the scene: you’re a developer building a system for a very small shop. They’ve been working primarily from spreadsheets, but feel they’re ready to move on to a real system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other developers are creating the rest of the system, we’re tasked with creating the method for retrieving the price for the products. As this is a very small outfit, we’re only going to start with one product. Very small outfit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re told that the product we’re going to be passed is an Apple, so following our mantra we’re going to write our test first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReturnsCorrectPriceForApples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AreEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;One apple should cost 50p.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that we’ve now written our first test, unfortunately this test will not pass yet as we can’t even compile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never fear, lets create the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now created the class, so the code compiles and we’re able to execute our first test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It failed. This one of the key steps in test-driven development. Make a test, and make it fail, then write the functionality required to make the test pass. Baring that in mind, we’ll now modify our code to allow the test to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It passed, that’s one test under our belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that this isn’t a very good design, but we’ve written enough code for the method to work for it’s current usage. We’re letting the tests drive our code, which means we’re ending up with only the code we require. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;YAGNI&lt;/span&gt;: You Aren’t Gonna Need It&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-second-product&quot;&gt;The Second Product&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our implementation of &lt;code&gt;GetPrice&lt;/code&gt; is painfully simple, so simple that we don’t even support multiple products. This worked fine for us while the customer only had one product, but they’ve now expanded and have requested their second product be added. Lets write another test to cover this new request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReturnsCorrectPriceForSausages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AreEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Sausages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;One pack of sausages should cost £2.99&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, if we compile and run this test it will fail, because we’ve hard-coded the method to always return &lt;code&gt;£0.50&lt;/code&gt;. So lets update the method to work for sausages too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test now passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, this code isn’t pretty, but it does the job. We could implement this in a much better way, but we don’t have the time, there’s always more urgent things that need doing. What’s important in what we’ve just been doing is creating the tests, which serve as our safety net for when we eventually do decide to make this code nicer. We know that by re-running our tests, our code still works as it did originally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;refactoring&quot;&gt;Refactoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple of months in our systems life. The customer now wants some more products adding, after all there’s only so much you can do with apples and sausages. They’ve supplied us with a list of products, with their prices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Product&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Price&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Potatoes&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;3.99&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Cola&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.27&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Bread&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;0.99&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Milk&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;0.47&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at our code, we can easily see that this is going to get messy, fast. This is where we turn to refactoring our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.” —Martin Fowler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test-driven development makes it easier for a developer to refactor, as the tests you create define a contract that the code must adhere to, any breaking of the contract is immediately noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets spend a small amount of time refactoring our current implementation to make it easier for future product additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Sausages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now made the code a bit cleaner, and the design a little bit more flexible. If we now re-run our tests, we will see that everything still passes. We are safe in the knowledge that everything the customer requested previously still works. We’re now safe to proceed with their new request, adding the new products. Thanks to our refactoring, this change is nice and easy. First things first, we need to create our tests to cover this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReturnsCorrectPricesForOtherProducts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AreEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Potatoes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Potatoes should be £3.99.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AreEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Cola&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Cola should be £1.27.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AreEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Bread&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Bread should be 99p.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AreEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Milk&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Milk should be 47p.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As should be realising by now, this test is going to fail. After running to confirm, we need to update our constructor to include the new products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wonder why we bothered to run the test when we know that it was going to fail. Well it’s a good practice to get into, because if you don’t actually witness your test failing, you don’t know for certain whether your test is actually correct. You might be testing the wrong thing. If your test passes when you expect it not to, you know there’s something wrong; but if you don’t catch it, your pass after your change won’t mean anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Sausuages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Potatoes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Cola&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Bread&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Milk&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this change, our test will now pass. We’ve now successfully completed our customer’s requirement, and our code has become a little bit more manageable in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boundary-conditions&quot;&gt;Boundary Conditions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer is happy with our implementation of their requirements, even if we can see some places for improvement, and the release date is looming. The customer starts integrating their existing data into our system. After importing the list of products from a spreadsheet, the system is given a thorough run through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer noticed that after importing the list of products, whenever anyone bought an apple, the system crashed. After some investigation, it ends up the spreadsheet with the products had apples in all lower-case, while our inventory has it stored with an upper-case letter a.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exposes a flaw in our testing logic. We’ve currently just been testing how we expect the method to behave under normal usage, but not actually testing how it will act if we pass it things other than what it’s expecting. Our tests should also be testing for invalid data and boundary conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boundary Condition:&lt;/strong&gt; A problem or situation that occurs only at a extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter.&lt;br /&gt;
An example of a boundary condition would be supplying &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;GetDaysInMonth&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invalid Input:&lt;/strong&gt; Anything outside standard operating expectations.&lt;br /&gt;
Using the same example as boundary conditions, invalid input would cover supplying &lt;code&gt;-6&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;76&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;GetDaysInMonth&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll write a test to cover the invalid input the customer encountered, we’ll pass in a valid product name, but one that’s capitalised incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReturnsCorrectProductPriceWhenPassedIncorrectCasedName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AreEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;AppLE&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Should return price of Apples, 50p.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running this test will fail, as usual. So lets fix the code to allow case-insensitive product names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sausuages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;potatoes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;cola&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;bread&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;milk&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0.47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ToLower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve modified our constructor to set the product names as lower-case, then modified our method to convert the inputted product name to lower-case as well. This way our searches are case-insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running all our tests should assure us that our existing code still functions, and we’re now safe from any case variations from the customer’s product list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While doing this change, it’s noticeable that we’re also not handling the case for if a price is requested for a product that isn’t in the inventory. If this occurs we really should pass a message up to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, so it can present the user with something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to this being an exceptional situation, it’s ideally suited to an exception! Let’s write a test to handle this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[Test, ExpectedException(typeof(InvalidProductException))]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ThrowsAnExceptionForAnInvalidProduct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inventory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;My Invalid Product&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve introduced a new attribute to our test in this case, &lt;code&gt;ExpectedException&lt;/code&gt;, this simply allows you to specify what exception you want a method to throw in the situation you’re testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This test requires the use of a custom exception, I’m not going to show the implementation here as it’s simple stuff. I’ve chosen to use a custom exception so our “GUI guys” know what to capture for this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s generally regarded as good practice to wrap your internal errors in something that’s meaningful to the rest of the application, hiding the implementation details. An &lt;code&gt;InvalidProductException&lt;/code&gt; is much easier to understand and implement than &lt;code&gt;NullReferenceException&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IndexOutOfRangeException&lt;/code&gt; etc. This is another topic in itself though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this test pass, we need to update our &lt;code&gt;GetPrice&lt;/code&gt; method to handle invalid products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GetPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ContainsKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;InvalidProductException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Product supplied, &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;, is not in the inventory.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now doing a simple check to see if the internal product Dictionary contains an entry for the requested product, if it doesn’t we’ll throw one of our &lt;code&gt;InvalidProductException&lt;/code&gt;’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running our test again will now assure us that our method throws an exception in these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now return to integration and the customer can be assured that it all works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-conclusions&quot;&gt;Learning Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have we witnessed in running through this little exercise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How easy it is to test first&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; It's really not that complicated. Once you've learnt to apply the restraint needed to stop yourself from just diving in, it's easy.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The security you get from tests&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; If you've come from an environment that doesn't have any code tests, you're probably enjoying the reassurance that tests bring. You're at least safe in the knowledge that you haven't broken anything existing with your new features. The more tests you introduce, the more solid your base for making changes becomes.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of refactoring&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; As with the above, it's easy to refactor your existing code when you've got a suite of tests in-place.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light-weight nature of your code&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; When you're only coding to make your tests pass, you're less likely to code features that aren't required. This makes your code as light as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-legacies&quot;&gt;Dealing with Legacies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets be honest here, nobody likes legacy code. You know the kind of code I mean. The code written by the mysterious and elusive previous developers. Usually it’s dire, sometimes it’s shocking, most of the time it’s untested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing legacy code can be a nightmare in itself, but it is possible. What you need to remember in this situation is that you can’t be a hero. There’s no way you can create a test suite that covers the whole system, it’s just not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best approach to testing legacy code is an incremental one. If you find a bug in the system, write a test that fails because of it, then fix the code and run your test. That way you have a test that covers that bug, and you’re now safe from that bug showing up again. Eventually, if you continue this way, you’ll end-up with a nice suite of tests covering your common bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the system you’re trying to test will be an unstructured mess, it’ll be very hard to separate out logical concerns. It may be possible for you to utilise mock and stub objects&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in these situations, which will help you break down the barriers. Sometimes even this isn’t possible, and these may be the cases where you’re either going to have to live with a few hundred lines of setup code for your tests, or live without automated testing, at least until you can rework the code to facilitate testing more readily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form of legacy that you’re no doubt going to encounter is that of the legacy mind. How you write code may have been turned on its head by the introduction of test-driven development, and you’re going to slip back into your old ways every now and again. This happens to everyone at some point, but if you can force yourself to maintain your standards then you’ll eventually break the barrier and you wont look back. If I code without unit tests now, I feel an overwhelming sense of insecurity and dirtiness. It’s a good thing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A usability moan about Adobe's website</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/a-usability-moan-about-adobes-website</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When recently performing a system-wide clean-out, I removed a long-expired Macromedia Flash 8 Studio trial. Unknown to me at the time, it had taken it upon itself to remove the flash player as-well; because, of course, now that I don’t want to develop flash, I’ll never need it again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a week or so later I discovered that I needed to re-install the player, so off I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com&quot;&gt;Adobe’s Website&lt;/a&gt;. When I arrived, I was presented with a fairly reasonable page - in terms of design - but there was something on there that epitomises the lack of thought that goes into usability on the web. People, you have to remember it isn’t just about how you create your links (bad “click here”, no play-time for you!), it’s also about how your content is worded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/adobe-flash-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adobe's no-flash warning message&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can see in the screenshot is what you’re shown if you don’t have the flash player installed (or JavaScript enabled, I’m guessing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s wrong with this picture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very misleading, that’s what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heading is asking me “Can’t see this content?”, but I can, can’t I? I’m reading it! Oh, the word “this” isn’t associated to what I’m reading (as it should be), but rather what I’m &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; reading. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misleading text has also found its way into the body content, once again, I am reading the content aren’t I? Another thing is that the content also implies that I have JavaScript disabled when I actually don’t. I believe you’re statistically more likely to have a user without flash installed, than without JavaScript enabled. So with that in mind, it would have been a better idea to ask if they have flash first then ask about JavaScript. Even better would be to do a check to see if JavaScript is enabled, if it is you don’t need to display that part of the message at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing, those controls at the bottom; what are they doing there? I know (now) that they’re there because the content that’s supposed to be showing is a movie, but prior to having that knowledge surely they just reinforce the feeling that I am seeing what I’m supposed to. I have content, I have play controls, hey why aren’t they working? They serve no purpose apart from to confuse the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-slightly-better-picture&quot;&gt;A slightly better picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve modified the content to be - in my eyes - a bit more respectable. It still isn’t perfect, like I said above, some JavaScript detection would be nice. Here it is non-the-less though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/adobe-flash-fixed.gif&quot; alt=&quot;An improved version of Adobe's message&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reading this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I most certainly am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you are reading this message, then you are unable to view our active content.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh dear, so that’s what this is all about. How do I fix it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Please either download the latest version of the Macromedia Flash Player or enable JavaScript in your browser.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will do, thanks for the help Mr. Usable Information Box.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your Forms Are Killing Me</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/your-forms-are-killing-me</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: I have no particular dislike of the website in question, in fact I read it on a regular basis, but what I’m about to talk about is a travesty. Although it does tie in rather nicely with a previous post of mine: &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/bloated-forms&quot;&gt;Bloated Forms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was browsing one of my regular watering holes (water of knowledge, of course!) - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theserverside.net&quot;&gt;The Server Side.Net&lt;/a&gt; - and I felt the overwhelming urge to make a reply in the forum. Registration was required, of course, so off to register I went. What followed was purely horrible on so many levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-one&quot;&gt;Step One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tss-first.gif&quot; alt=&quot;First form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was first presented with the rather humble request of entering my e-mail address, nothing un-expected here and to be honest, quite refreshing in its simplicity. I thought I may just receive an e-mail with a pre-generated password and that’d be it… but it wasn’t to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-two&quot;&gt;Step Two&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tss-second.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Second form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was a list of ten check boxes for various newsletters I could subscribe to. I don’t know how many people actually use these “features” of registration forms, but I just wanted to register. If I wanted to receive newsletters I would opt-in from within my account once registered. In their defence, the checkboxes did at least default to false!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On a side note, how is it not understood that you should give the user as little to deal with as possible? Especially when you’re trying to get them to sign-up to your services, you should get them in as quickly as possible, no fuss, no mess and people won’t lose interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-three&quot;&gt;Step Three&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tss-third.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Third form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a whopper, scarily so. Baring in mind that all I want to do is make one post on their forum, this seems a tad excessive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly they want my first and last name, fair enough but I’d say even just my name, singular, would suffice. Next are my Company Name and my Title at said company, followed by my full address, postal code, telephone number and fax number. These are a bit odd, especially considering I might be unemployed and/or unwilling to disclose such information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what the next sections were, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theserverside.net&quot;&gt;The Server Side&lt;/a&gt; are seriously interested in &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; company. They’re asking such in-depth questions as what my IT budget is, how many employees are at the company, how many of those are developers, the purchasing scope and the industry of my organisation. Woah. Who even knows that stuff? Never mind wants to disclose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I get to choose which technologies are relevant to me, via another big list of checkboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that huge list wasn’t bad enough, to put the proverbial icing on the cake, 90% of the fields are &lt;strong&gt;mandatory&lt;/strong&gt;! Yes, even the IT Budget and Purchasing Scope. Absolute madness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-four&quot;&gt;Step Four&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tss-fourth.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Fourth form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there’s more. This is merely a finalisation of my e-mail and a password. Nothing fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end&quot;&gt;The End&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I encountered step three, all I thought of was targeted advertising; something I definitely do not want to be a part of. I’m shocked to be honest, it’s a sad state of affairs when so much information needs to be gathered just to allow simple forum/comment posting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t make it past the form - The Server Side has lost my gems of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Internet Explorer's conditional comments for targeted JavaScript</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/using-ies-conditional-comments-for-targeted-javascript</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx&quot;&gt;demise of CSS hacks&lt;/a&gt;, something which has been covered elsewhere to no end, definitely a good thing, but not what I’m covering here - not directly anyway. I’ve been wondering if we can take advantage of this new age of “hack segregation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it is we’re already breaking the rule of separation by using conditional comments in the structure, so why don’t we cease this opportunity to save our friends (users of Firefox, Safari, Opera etc…) some bandwidth by providing IE specific JavaScript in the same way too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those wondering what I could mean by “IE specific JavaScript”, an example would be simulating the CSS focus pseudo class on form elements - something highly recommended for an accessible and usable form - which aren’t implemented in the market standard versions of Internet Explorer (6 and below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think users of compliant browsers should be punished by downloading extraneous scripts, loading events into the queue and then spending time evaluating code that doesn’t even apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proposing that we devote a section of the page &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; tag to Internet Explorer, that’s simply a conditional comment section that contains any style sheets and script blocks that only apply to IE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-1-what-we-are-doing&quot;&gt;Example 1 (what we are doing)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if lt IE 7]&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/css/ie-specific.css&quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/js/ie-specific.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'load'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doIEStuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-2-what-we-could-be-doing&quot;&gt;Example 2 (what we could be doing)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if lt IE 7]&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/css/ie-specific.css&quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/ie-specific.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;
  addEvent(window, 'load', doIEStuff);
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Example 1&lt;/em&gt; only Internet Explorer (prior to version 7) will download the stylesheet, but all browsers download the “ie-specific.js” JavaScript file and evaluate the &lt;code&gt;addEvent&lt;/code&gt; code block. However if we follow &lt;em&gt;Example 2&lt;/em&gt;, Internet Explorer will download the JavaScript and CSS just like normal, but other browsers simply see the whole section as a standard html comment and thus won’t download anything or evaluate the code block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderful, eh? I feel more comfortable with this approach than using questionable browser detection methods in JavaScript and it also reinforces (by just a tiny little bit) that compliant browsers are faster than their non-compliant brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bloated forms</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/bloated-forms</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what it is, but there seems to be an inherent urge of web developers (or designers, managers or whomever) to create forms that are hugely bloated and pointless, even for simple things such as sending a contact e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fascination with bloated forms is incomprehensible to me, I just can’t understand why anybody would want to know the gender or official title of somebody who’s simply trying to say “Hello”; it’s irrelevant, all I personally care about is what they’ve got to say. Is it supposed to portray the company in an intelligent, professional manner? (&lt;em&gt;These people want my title, they obviously mean business!&lt;/em&gt;) I don’t know, but it needs to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally am a lot less inclined to fill out a form if it feels like an interrogation. Contact forms should consist of me entering my name, some form of contact information and my brain-dump - nothing else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fairly-standard-form&quot;&gt;Fairly standard form&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/form-bad.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bad form layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;suggested-form&quot;&gt;Suggested form&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/form-good.png&quot; alt=&quot;Good form layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know which one I’d prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amusing &quot;Recommend a Friend&quot; usage</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/amusing-quotrecommend-a-friendquot-usage</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been sending out a (rather successful) e-mail campaign for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swiftleisure.co.uk&quot;&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; over the past few days, a good experience and definitely an eye opener. Something that amused me over the course of the project was the way people were using the “Recommend a Friend” feature of the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re presented by a form, which asks for your friends name, e-mail address and some form of comment from yourself, what would you put in the name field? Common sense says that you should put their full name in, as generally that’s what people want; not these people though! Over 50% of the recommendations were supplied with first names only or nicknames - the most wonderful being “MUM”; yes, block capitals too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have a nice collection of recommendations along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;George&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sally&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Geoff&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;liz&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;MUM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll love the targeted e-mails they’re bound to receive too; “Dear MUM, we think…”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQL Server Object Exists Function</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/sql-server-object-exists-function</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Added separate versions for SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005, due to the differences in the system objects tables.It may just be me, but when writing migration/create scripts for use with SQL Server I get quite agitated at having to write an ugly, long-winded, drop statement at the start of every object definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support for dropping objects is one of the few things I would say MySQL has SQL Server over the barrel for.Baring in mind that if you try to drop an object that doesn’t exist, you’ll get an execution error; here’s how to drop a table in MySQL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;DROP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to drop the same table, if you’re using SQL Server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OBJECT_ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OBJECT_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'customers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'U'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;DROP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, when something annoys you enough and you’re in the middle of something else, it’s about time you wrote that solution. So I’ve created a simple user-defined function that checks if an object exists then returns a &lt;code&gt;BIT 0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; depending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the function, all you have to do is call &lt;code&gt;dbo.ObjectExists&lt;/code&gt; with two parameters, the first being the name of the object you want to check on, the second being the type of object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dbo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectExists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'customers'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'U'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;DROP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Common Object Types:&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; - Stored Procedure&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; - User Table&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;code&gt;FN&lt;/code&gt; - User-Defined Function&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this little function, you can now almost match the simplicity of MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-now-the-code&quot;&gt;…and now the code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sql-server-2000&quot;&gt;SQL Server 2000&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FUNCTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dbo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectExists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;RETURNS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BIT&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;RETURN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Exists&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;END&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Console in Safari</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/javascript-console-in-safari</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick tip to enable the Debug menu in Safari, the main reason being to get the JavaScript Console (ala Firefox).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply close down your open instances of Safari and enter this into the Terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’ll enable a new Debug menu next time you start Safari, simple as that. I was on the verge of loading up Firefox on the Mac&lt;br /&gt;
before I came across this, bad James!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, just in-case, running the above again with 0 will turn off the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ruby on Rails Recognition Failed in Production mode</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/ruby-on-rails-recognition-failed-in-production-mode</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The title pretty much covers it, but i’ll elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I decided it was about time I had a tinker with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps&quot;&gt;Google Sitemaps&lt;/a&gt;, part of which involves uploading a temporary file so google can be sure the website you’re trying to claim is actually yours. Anyway, fun things aside, google gave me an error message (“We’ve detected that your 404 (file not found) error page returns a status of 200 (OK) in the header.”) when it tried to read the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error message was caused by a feature of Ruby on Rails, which when in Development mode, invalid pages are still served by Rails and sent with a 200 header, but logged as having a Routing error of “Recognition failed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All information pointed to a simple fix of setting the rails environment (&lt;code&gt;ENV['RAILS_ENV']&lt;/code&gt;) to production mode, which would disable the aforementioned feature. Unfortunately for me, my environment was &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; set to production! I double checked this, logged into the ruby console on my web-server and checked the variables, then even checked which log file was being written to; everything was pointing to it being in production mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of browsing of forums and chatting in IRC channels, I succumbed to randomly trying anything, which is when i noticed in my environment.rb file there was a line of code that I couldn’t for the life of me remember why it was in there, or what it was doing; removing this line of code worked a treat, everything snapped back to how it should be functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future reference, the line in question was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'error_handler_basic'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# defines AC::Base#rescue_action_in_public&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go, now I have a 404 page and google accepted my site map, so we can all live happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uncrippling Windows XP's IIS 5.1</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/uncrippling-windows-xps-iis-51</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I apparently got around to reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com&quot;&gt;Coding Horror&lt;/a&gt; a bit too late, as I missed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000329.html&quot; title=&quot;Uncrippling Windows XP's IIS 5.1&quot;&gt;this gem&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an article about a small application used to bend XP’s IIS to your every whim, perfect for those of us suffering at the hands of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic gist of the application is that it removes the limits of XP’s IIS, namely the problem of only being allowed one website and 10 concurrent users. It takes a bit of getting used to, especially if you’re using Visual Studio; if you are, remember to reset IIS to it’s default website before opening a website created prior to using IISAdmin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ServerControlIDs Update</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/servercontrolids-update</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve created a small update for my ServerControlIDs control, which removes the problem caused by controls within Repeaters and DataGrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had a repeater that for each item contained an Hyperlink control, you’d get a duplicate entry in the ClientIDs object for every record, to avoid this problem I simply don’t output any sub-controls from within repeater style objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may sound like a bit of a hack, maybe it is, but if you want to refer to multiple elements within another, you shouldn’t really be doing it by ID anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jagregory.com/downloads/ServerControlIDs-1.1.zip&quot;&gt;updated source here&lt;/a&gt; or view the &lt;a href=&quot;/writings/how-to-use-clientids-in-javascript-without-the-ugliness/&quot; title=&quot;ASP.Net ClientIDs and their JavaScript companion&quot;&gt;full article here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The problem with onload</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/the-problem-with-onload</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Handling events from within your page has always been a hit and miss affair, especially for somebody who doesn’t like mixing their code and markup. The way to go with events for a long time was to embed an attribute on the element in question; like &lt;code&gt;onclick=&quot;do_something()&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That works fine, but we sure know it isn’t semantic. The way forward — greatly popularised by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://prototype.conio.net&quot;&gt;Prototype&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dojotoolkit.org/&quot;&gt;Dojo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bennolan.com/behaviour/&quot;&gt;Behaviour&lt;/a&gt; libraries — is to use DOM compliant event listeners. These fire arbitrary code, in a very similar way to attributes, when an event is raised. Unlike attributes these event listeners can be hidden away in their rightful place, the document header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect - clean semantic markup and real event handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…or is it? Unfortunately nothing is ever smooth when dealing with standards (it’s hard to promote the underdog when the underdog barely works anyway…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-problem&quot;&gt;Our Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest setback for using event listeners is that nothing will fire until the whole of the body has finished loading, including any images that need to be downloaded. This can cause something similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluerobot.com/web/css/fouc.asp&quot; title=&quot;Flash of Unstyled Content&quot;&gt;FOUC&lt;/a&gt;, where a page appears in one state for a moment until the javascript executes; not a pretty sight and generally hard to sell as a browser fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had the following code in your header tag, the element &lt;code&gt;aTable&lt;/code&gt; would be visible until the page has finished loading, at which point it would suddenly disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hideATable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'aTable'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'display'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'none'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'load'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hideATable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we really need is an &lt;code&gt;onBodyRendered&lt;/code&gt; event to hook to, which fires as soon as the body has been parsed, irrelevant of whether the content has been loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real solution to this problem, as there isn’t an &lt;code&gt;onBodyRendered&lt;/code&gt; event, is to force the browser to parse our javascript before it has finished loading. The method of doing this is to embed a script block just before the end of the body tag containing the functions you wish to execute. The reason this works is because the browser parses any javascript it encounters within the body tag and evaluates it while rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following code would hide the table before the page has finished rendering; exactly what we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hideATable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-additions&quot;&gt;My additions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above method isn’t completely desirable, because it is still mixing code with markup and any code within the footer will not be cached. There isn’t much you can do about that really, but one thing that i’ve taken to doing in my websites is to make sure there is only ever one function call in that footer script block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My method of doing such a thing is to create a special object that represents all my pages and their individual footer script blocks. You can see below an example of such an object, there’s an wrapper object that allows for further extensions (such as Unload or Validation sections) and then the Load object that contains each pages onload function. Each page then has a single line script block like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Pages.Load.Home();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Pages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;highlightSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hideSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;saveCookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Portfolio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hideSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;makeMeLookGood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;highlightFields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the above code is stored in an external js file and loaded in the usual way, thus being cached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before&quot;&gt;Before:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;highlightSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hideSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;saveCookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after&quot;&gt;After:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How-to use ClientIDs in JavaScript without the ugliness</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/how-to-use-clientids-in-javascript-without-the-ugliness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASP.Net has an interesting way of handing the potential ID conflicts caused by embedding third-party controls within your web-page; it prefixes any sub-controls with their parent’s ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;asp:TextBox ID=&quot;txtUsername&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; within a standard page simply has an ID of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;txtUsername&lt;/code&gt; within the HTML output. On the other hand, the following example would result in something along the lines of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_parent_txtUsername&lt;/code&gt; as the ID:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;parent&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;runat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;server&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;asp:TextBox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ID=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;txtUsername&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Runat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;server&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t really much of a problem when all you are working with is server-side code, but when you start tinkering with JavaScript, things become quite annoying and get an overall feeling of hackiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution, which I have used time-and-again, is to use a script block at the end of your page where you create a series of variables that contain the actual IDs. You then use these variables to reach the actual elements via JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtUsernameID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&amp;lt;%= txtUsername.ClientID %&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtPasswordID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&amp;lt;%= txtPassword.ClientID %&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution works fine, but it isn’t exactly pretty and it doesn’t weigh well on my conscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;javascript-mapping&quot;&gt;Javascript Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve created a simple class that traverses the control structure and outputs an object that contains the mappings, as above, but without any client-side intervention; not a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%= ...ClientID %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the output would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ClientIDs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtUsername&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ctrl0_txtUsername'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtPassword&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ctrl0_txtPassword'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which enables you to reference elements, that you know are server-controls, by calling &lt;code&gt;ClientIDs.txtUsername&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before&quot;&gt;Before:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtUsernameID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&amp;lt;%= txtUsername.ClientID %&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtPasswordID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&amp;lt;%= txtPassword.ClientID %&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtUsernameID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtPasswordID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'james'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;you shouldn't be here!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after&quot;&gt;After:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ClientIDs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtUsername&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ClientIDs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;txtPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'james'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;you shouldn't be here!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;servercontrolids-class&quot;&gt;ServerControlIDs class&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;void Emit(page)&lt;/code&gt; - Builds the controls of the page into a mapped structure, registering a client-side script block for the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;void Emit(control, literal)&lt;/code&gt; - Builds the controls of the control into a mapped structure, rendering the output into the literal control supplied. The literal is best suited to being placed into the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, which helps improve the semantic nature of your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;properties&quot;&gt;Properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool Whitespace&lt;/code&gt; - Sets whether the output should contain whitespace, provided only for “prettifying” your code; defaults to off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;string VariableName&lt;/code&gt; - Sets the JavaScript variable name used; defaults to ClientID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this class, simply create an instance in the PreRender event for your page — this ensures that all the controls have been set to their correct state — then call the Emit method you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[1.1] Removed IDs from Repeater/DataGrid contained controls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[1.0] Initial release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all there is to it, use the link below to get the latest version of ServerControlIDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this code isn’t pretty and it could probably do with some revising, but it works and that’s what’s important to me. I’m open to suggestions and feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jagregory.com/downloads/ServerControlIDs-1.1.zip&quot;&gt;Current Version (1.1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello from JAGregory.com!</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/hello-from-jagregorycom</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You should now be receiving this syndicated content from my new(ish) website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jagregory.com&quot;&gt;http://www.jagregory.com&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve finally moved away from the .Text powered blogging system I’ve been using for the past few years in favour of Typo, a Ruby on Rails system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few reasons for doing this but the main one is that my blog as well as my personal website both validate to &lt;acronym title=&quot;Extensible Hypertext Markup Language&quot;&gt;XHTML&lt;/acronym&gt; 1.0. On top of that, with the dynamic nature of Ruby on Rails, I can make changes to the layouts without having to recompile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please drop me a line if you spot anything out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Behaviour &amp; getElementsBySelector() mini-fix</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/javascript-behaviour-amp-getelementsbyselector-mini-fix</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bennolan.com/behaviour/&quot;&gt;Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, great bit of JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While using it lately I came across a small bug in the code it’s based-on, &lt;a href=&quot;http://simon.incutio.com/&quot;&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/03/25/getElementsBySelector&quot;&gt;getElementsBySelector()&lt;/a&gt;, when you use a selector that references an invalid ID paired with a tag name (e.g. &lt;code&gt;body#profile&lt;/code&gt;, when &lt;code&gt;#profile&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t exist), a script error occurs; yet using &lt;code&gt;#profile&lt;/code&gt; alone works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of digging I found a solution, the source of the error is line 89:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tagName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nodeName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s finding the &lt;code&gt;tagName&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;), but element is undefined due to the ID being invalid. A slight change to the above if statement fixes the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tagName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nodeName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe somebody will find that useful, I’ve posted it on Simons blog, but incase he doesn’t accept the change you can download the modified version here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: If you’re using Behaviour, as opposed to just &lt;code&gt;getElementsBySelector()&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll need to paste the contents of the above file into the bottom of your behaviour.js file, overwriting everything after the &lt;code&gt;Behaviour.start();&lt;/code&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Accessibility for UK based websites</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/accessibility-for-uk-based-websites</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/&quot;&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;, a new set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4783686.stm&quot;&gt;accessibility guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have been developed for UK websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this certainly isn’t anything new — being as a law was passed in 1999 for compliance — and it isn’t even legally binding, it may be used in court if a case arises. This is just one more little pebble added to the mounting landslide that will occur when a disabled user finally does the american thing and sues a company for not providing sufficient means to access their website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trust Wireless Scroll Tablet with Dual Monitors</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/trust-wireless-scroll-tablet-ampamp-dual-monitors</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a task and a half! As I mentioned earlier I somehow managed to get my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DCL6G/202-4350795-3732661&quot;&gt;Trust Wireless Scroll Tablet&lt;/a&gt; working on a dual monitor system, mapped to only the primary monitor; so here’s my little guide on how I managed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware there isn’t an option in the trust software to allow you to map to a specific monitor, only to restrict the area on the tablet (which isn’t at all helpful). So what I’ve figured out is purely a work around, and it isn’t great either&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is mainly for my reference, but someone else might find it useful, so here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open up Display Properties and disable (“un-attach”) your secondary monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open the Trust Control Panel from the icon in your system tray.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Re-enable your second monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click ok in your Trust Control Panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there on out your tablet should only be mapped to the monitor that stayed enabled the whole time, that is until you re-open the Trust Control Panel. I didn’t say it was pretty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I can gather is that after disabling your monitor, when you open up the control panel it maps the overall screen size so it can apply that to the tablet, but when you click OK after re-enabling the monitor it doesn’t refresh with the screen change and so uses the single monitor values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Also note that I have only tested this on my system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Personal Note: A brief interlude</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/just-so-you-know</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, while working on my website I’ve become exposed to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bennolan.com/behaviour/&quot;&gt;Behaviour JavaScript library&lt;/a&gt;, which I may say is absolutely wonderful. Very simple and straight forward, completely removes the need for those cursed script tags appended to the bottom of a page; something which I’ve never liked doing but became a bit of a necessary burden! In short it allows you to execute arbitrary code on elements in the DOM using CSS selectors; so, for example, you can apply an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt; event only to elements which match &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;form fieldset div#items a.add&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, very handy indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the web I got my hands on a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007A5FZS/qid=1141728007/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-0724979-2170829&quot;&gt;Star Wars: Empire at War&lt;/a&gt;, which is easily the best Star Wars RTS game I’ve played (which isn’t hard). Very entertaining, if a little same-y after a while. Definitely worth playing though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even further outside of the web — in the real world — Sara and I got tickets for the Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age and Motörhead show in Hyde Park, London. That should be an entertaining night and it’s a very good excuse to get ourselfs down to London again, a city we really enjoyed last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Any anchors with a class of “add”, within a div with an ID of “items” that itself is within a fieldset in a form tag.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A time to doodle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After being inspired by Kevin Cornell at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bearskinrug.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Bearskinrug&lt;/a&gt; I finally decided to try a drawing tablet, one of those magical designer tools. I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DCL6G/026-0724979-2170829?%5Fencoding=UTF8&quot;&gt;Trust 1200-V2 Wireless Scroll Tablet&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon for a fairly reasonable £40, which was an absolute breeze to set up, windows picked it up without the need to install the drivers, which is always nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main complaint with it is that I was unable to (logically) get the tablet to map to anything less than both of my monitors, which was rubbish because that meant the tablet was being stretched horizontally; so you couldn’t trace anything without it becoming distorted. I say logically, because last thing yesterday I somehow managed it, so my tablet maps to my primary monitor and my mouse continues to work across both - it’ll take me a bit of time to get used to swapping but it’s definitely worth it. I will try and figure out how I managed to get it working, so I can at least make a note of it for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all I need to do is learn how to draw… I’m currently at &lt;a href=&quot;http://neopoleon.com/&quot;&gt;Rory&lt;/a&gt;’s standard of drawing, which of course is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Venkman for Firefox 1.5.0.1 (Javascript Debugger)</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/venkman-for-firefox-1501-javascript-debugger</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again the guys at Mozilla have broken quite possibly the best plug-in for Firefox: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/&quot;&gt;Venkman Javascript Debugger&lt;/a&gt;. This is becoming quite commonplace, with every update for firefox disabling the debugger until a fix is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, even though both the extensions manager and Venkmans official website both say there aren’t any updates available, Joe Walker from &lt;a href=&quot;http://getahead.ltd.uk/home&quot;&gt;Getahead&lt;/a&gt; has created and update that contains some bug fixes from Bugzilla, but most importantly Venkman now works with Firefox 1.5.0.1!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First working weekend</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/first-working-weekend</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The weekend just past was my first that I’ve had to work since I left Tesco. Not an entirely unpleasant experience, although I would have much rather had my weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we had to work the weekend was down to us launching (re-launching actually) a product for the Swift Group’s extranet, something that a lot of people had been rather worried about. Mainly because, apparently, the previous time this product was launched it corrupted important data for six months without anyone noticing. Wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I wasn’t too happy about when I first inherited this project is that it was my sole responsibility. Slowly I came around to the idea though, it would be all my fault if everything went wrong, true, but it’d also be all down to me if everything went well; looks pretty good being responsible for a whole project only 10 months into a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is now day 1 of the launch at an end and a few niggling things aside, everything went swimmingly. No show stopping bugs at all, only minor things that took barely more than a minute to fix. I can safely say I’m in the good books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to day 2 going as well as day 1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript getNextElement and getPreviousElement - revised</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/javascript-getnextelement-and-getpreviouselement-revised</link>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a very old post. Please, stop reading and just &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;download jQuery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said I would be in my previous post, I’ve been working on improving getNextElement. I’ve improved the overall performance of the function and also created a few others with similar purpose; including the sister function getPrevious element. I outline all the functions and their uses below; you can find the download link at the top and bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any bugs anyone finds don’t fret to email me or post a comment here, i’ll work on fixing them asap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-functions&quot;&gt;The Functions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getnextelement--getpreviouselement&quot;&gt;getNextElement &amp;amp; getPreviousElement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically this function is a more advanced, flexible version of the “element.nextSibling” and “element.previousSibling” properties. Features include the ability to specify the next element you’e looking for explicitly, so you can return the next list-item in a list (even if it happens to be a child of the current element) or the next matching node type. Also recursion is toggleable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getfirstchild--getlastchild&quot;&gt;getFirstChild &amp;amp; getLastChild&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core part of getNextElement/getPreviousElement, this function recursively searches an elements child nodes for a matching element. Can be used stand alone to only return from within an elements child structure; recursively parses the childNode structures of all child elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getnextparent--getpreviousparent&quot;&gt;getNextParent &amp;amp; getPreviousParent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gets the next node in the DOM tree after the current nodes parent; this walks the DOM tree backwards until it finds a parent of the current node with a nextSibling/previousSibling present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;istype&quot;&gt;isType&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detects whether a specified element is of correct type; compares against a numerical value (nodeType) or a string value (tagName).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-examples&quot;&gt;The Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: All functions that require an element as a parameter can either take a direct reference or a string ID value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getnextelement--getpreviouselement-1&quot;&gt;getNextElement &amp;amp; getPreviousElement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both functions take exactly the same parameters and are used in the same way, so I’ll only provide examples for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: These functions also walk up the DOM tree, so if you have two lists and call getNextElement on the last list-item in the first list it will return the first item of the second list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns the next element, regardless of type, after id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'li'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns the next list item, after id; could potentially be a child of id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns the next element with a nodeType of 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'li'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns the next list-item that resides on the same level, or higher, as id; no child nodes are searched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practical-example&quot;&gt;Practical example:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;popup&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a popup&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;paragraph&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Below are some options:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Your first choice&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;secondItem&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Your second choice&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'popup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would most likely return whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'popup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the H1 tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'paragraph'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'li'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the first list-item, “Your first choice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getPreviousElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'secondItem'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ul'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the UL element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getPreviousElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'paragraph'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the paragraph element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getfirstchild--getlastchild-1&quot;&gt;getFirstChild &amp;amp; getLastChild&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, both these functions take the same parameters and behave the same way so I’ll only provide examples for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFirstChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns the first child of id, regardless of type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFirstChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'li'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns the first child of id that is a list-item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFirstChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns the first child of id that has a nodeType of 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practical-example-1&quot;&gt;Practical example:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;popup&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a popup&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Below are some options:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Your first choice&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Your second choice&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFirstChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'popup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would most likely return a Text node with some whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFirstChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'popup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the H1 element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFirstChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'popup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'li'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the first list-item, “Your first choice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getLastChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'popup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, probably whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getLastChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'popup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the UL element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getLastChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'popup'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'li'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the last list-item, “Your second choice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getnextparent--getpreviousparent-1&quot;&gt;getNextParent &amp;amp; getPreviousParent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, both these functions take the same parameters, so I’ll only show one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns the node next to the parent of id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practical-example-2&quot;&gt;Practical example:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;first&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Item One&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;second&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Item Two&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getNextParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'first'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the second UL element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getPreviousParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'second'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would return the first UL element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;istype-1&quot;&gt;isType&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'li'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns true if id has a tagName of ‘li’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns true if id has a nodeType of 3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AJAX and Security</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/ajax-and-security</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been creating a content management system over the past few weeks with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a new web project. One thing that has caught my eye is the potential security risk when using AJAX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For said project I’ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajax.schwarz-interactive.de/csharpsample/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Ajax.Net library&lt;/a&gt; which, like most others, outputs wrapped calls to a server-side functions in javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind then, surely anyone can open up the rendered source, see your methods and then execute them at will, potentially causing havoc. Initially I was using Ajax for most of my interaction with the server - something which seems pointless in hindsight. This meant that I had a create user function exposed to the public, potentially anyone could create themselves an account within the system by using the Javascript. This isn’t much of a problem from within the context of this project, because you can only ever view the page with the javascript when you’re authorised to create users; so it doesn’t make any difference. If this was public though, it could be a serious security risk. An example could be a comment form on a blog post, if you expose the method of creating a new comment through javascript then someone, with a little bit of work, could use the javascript to post automated comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, nothing major but I think it is definitely something you should bare in mind when creating your pages. I guess the moral of this little story is don’t use Ajax for the sake of it and if you do use it make sure that the functions you are calling are harmless. Anything dealing with security should be left to post-backs but user experience improving features are fine - auto complete text boxes for example.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prototype PeriodicalExecuter.stop() JavaScript function</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/prototype-periodicalexecuter-stop-javascript-function</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Download: &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; title=&quot;Prototype extensions javascript file&quot;&gt;prototype-extensions.js&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;(this download is no longer available, sorry)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://prototype.conio.net/&quot;&gt;prototype framework&lt;/a&gt; for a while now and am very impressed, the file size is a bit of a down point but that aside it’s excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that has slightly irritated me (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://roberthanson.blogspot.com/2005/11/prototypejs-periodicalexecuter.html&quot; title=&quot; Robert Hanson's Blog&quot;&gt;others it seems&lt;/a&gt;) is that there isn’t a stop function built into the PeriodicalExecuter object. Seems something strangly simple to miss out, especially as the Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater has one built in. With that in mind I’ve made an extension my self to perform this function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve simply placed the following code in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jagregory.com/downloads/prototype-extensions.js&quot; title=&quot;Prototype extensions javascript file&quot;&gt;prototype-extensions.js&lt;/a&gt; file and referenced it wherever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PeriodicalExecuter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;registerCallback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;intervalID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onTimerEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;frequency&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PeriodicalExecuter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;intervalID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s really nothing much going on in this code, all it does is take the current registerCallback function (which creates the actual timer) and stores its returned interval ID which we then use in the new stop function with the native clearInterval method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example implementation where I fire the PeriodicalExecuter when a key is released in a text box and then stop it once the call completes, this was the main reason I created this extension, my aim was to have a waiting period of a few seconds before a ajax lookup is performed; mainly to cut down on server calls. Each time the textbox changes the PeriodicalExecuter gets reset and started again which means the function will only ever fire once the countdown is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;changer&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'changer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onkeyup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PeriodicalExecuter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;textChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;textChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'check textbox content against database here'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this method of extension is probably frowned upon from within the community and changes are expected to be submitted for the actual library, but I needed a fix asap and I’m sure a few other people might too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nested DataGrid/Repeater with Key Value access</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/nested-datagridrepeater-with-key-value-access</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my colleagues was having a problem with a datagrid nested in a repeater. We’ve done this kind of thing before with no problems, but this time the dataset wasn’t allowing key access to columns (i.e &lt;code&gt;Container.DataItem(&quot;ID&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;). We toiled for quite some time trying to figure out why, with no avail. Eventually we just ended up using the direct index of the column; which worked fine as long as we didn’t change the column ordering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-aspx-vb&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;asp:Repeater id=&quot;rptLogins&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container, &quot;DataItem.Password&quot;) %&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;asp:DataGrid id=&quot;dgUsageDetail&quot; Runat=&quot;server&quot; DataSource='%# Container.DataItem.Row.GetChildRows(&quot;myRelation&quot;) %&amp;gt;' AutoGenerateColumns=&quot;false&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;Columns&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;asp:TemplateColumn HeaderText=&quot;Date&quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;ItemTemplate&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container, &quot;DataItem(1)&quot;, &quot;{0:dd/MM/yyyy}&quot;) %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/asp:TemplateColumn&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;asp:TemplateColumn HeaderText=&quot;Time&quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;ItemTemplate&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container, &quot;DataItem(1)&quot;, &quot;{0:T}&quot;) %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/asp:TemplateColumn&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;asp:TemplateColumn HeaderText=&quot;Page Visited&quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;ItemTemplate&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%# Container.DataItem(2) %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/asp:TemplateColumn&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/Columns&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/asp:DataGrid&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ItemTemplate&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/asp:Repeater&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never happy with this solution, for the above reason. In my opinion if you’re referencing columns you should never, ever reference them by index because it’s making your code reliant on the physical structure of the database. Something you may not have any control over what-so-ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just now I was working on my own little project (…on my lunch) and I needed to do the same thing; perfect time for some investigation. If you look at the DataSource of the above nested datagrid you’ll see it’s bound to the current rows &lt;code&gt;GetChildRows&lt;/code&gt; method, ends up (fairly obviously in hind sight) this returns a simple 1-dimensional array of DataRow objects. These DataRow objects (to my knowledge) basically contain an internal array of values, these values map to their parents &lt;code&gt;Columns&lt;/code&gt; collection. There’s no reference to the actual name of the column, hence why the key access doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is quite simple. So simple it’s unbelievable… Replace &lt;code&gt;Row.GetChildRows(&quot;myRelation&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Row.CreateChildView(&quot;myRelation&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. This creates a DataView object of the child rows, so essentially it’s a mini-dataset for you to deal with as if it were standard. Keyed referencing is back in action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: For those that are wondering, a dataview isn’t actually a mini-dataset but a filtered view of its parent dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>SQL Server: Exists() function quicker than Count()</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/sql-server-exists-function-quicker-than-count</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve seen the title; it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running an “administration” query to modify a table with around 190,000 records in. This table, segments, contains a status column called Coded. This value is derived from another table, faults. If any faults belonging to a segment has a coded status of 0 then the segment coded value is also 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My query did an update on each row in the segments table, retrieving a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; of how many faults there are with a coded status of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; that belong to the current segment. If the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; then the segment coded is set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ran for over 2 hours without any sign of finishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed the query to do a simple case statement with an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/code&gt; on the faults table where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Coded = 0&lt;/code&gt; and it’s just finished in 4 minutes. Unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I should give a bit of an explanation as to why this is happening. It basically all boils down to the way the two functions operate that makes the biggest difference. A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; statement counts every row that matches the where statement, so even if you only need to know about one record (like in my case) it’ll still read every other row too. On the other hand the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/code&gt; function will return as soon as its conditions are met, so if the first row it finds matches it’ll only read one row.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DateDiff() minus one VisualBasic assembly</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/datediff-minus-one-visualbasic-assembly</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not a big fan of using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Microsoft.VisualBasic&lt;/code&gt; assembly, I avoid it at all costs basically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, the visual basic assembly comes with a large collection of built-in functions one of which is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DateDiff&lt;/code&gt; function. This takes two dates and a comparison value (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; for day) and then spits out the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the same thing just minus the visual basic usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;firstDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;secondDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TimeSpan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;difference&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;secondDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Subtract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;firstDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// days: difference.Days

      <title>Launching woes</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/launching-woes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Launch problems, they always occur. Yesterday (1st September) was no exception, we launched this years Swift Leisure website; a bloody huge site. As soon as it got up there it fell over, which was unfortunate. After some investigation we narrowed it down to the Url Rewriter that we have in place (unfortunately, solely my work!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big problem with it was that it replaces the Request.ApplicationPath in any requested path with a blank string to remove any unnecessary parts of the path; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SwiftLeisure2006/Caravans/Abbey&lt;/code&gt; became &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Caravans/Abbey&lt;/code&gt;. This worked fine on our local setup but we didn’t account for possible changes in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request.ApplicationPath&lt;/code&gt; when the site is situated directly in the root instead of a sub-folder. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request.ApplicationPath&lt;/code&gt; became just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; which means &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/Caravans/Abbey&lt;/code&gt; became &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CaravansAbbey&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Caravans/Abbey&lt;/code&gt;. Simple fix once we figured this out and found any similar sections throughout our controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live and learn, live and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accessibility, standards and my say</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/accessibility-standards-and-my-say</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web has come a long way in the past few years, but it is still hindered greatly by the methodology of the “previous generation” of web-designers. People are still designing with the mentality of serving everyone with a page that is specifically tailored to suit their particular browser and operating system. While this did get the job done originally, it was most certainly a lot more work than it needed to be. That’s why I find the idea of generating one (and only one) document to serve all users very interesting. Most browsers are conforming to standards in some way shape or form, the majority support CSS2 and XHTML 1.1 and the ones that don’t (mostly) degrade gracefully. It’s no longer about serving a page that is pixel perfect on every system; it’s about making sure all users get a good experience from your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another branch of this takes the form of Accessibility. Accessibility has recently been highlighted by governments as a priority for websites; the US and UK both have their own take on the situation with relating laws and amendments. It basically boils down to any website that is providing a service should have a bare minimum of accessibility; otherwise they are discriminating against their less able customers. This means businesses are required, by law, to provide for all their customers (whether or not they have disabilities). Just as you would expect a shop to provide wheelchair ramps for disabled shoppers, you should expect pages to be designed to aid disabled web-users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I equipped my self with a screen-reader (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/software_jaws.asp&quot; title=&quot;JAWS Screen Reader&quot;&gt;JAWS&lt;/a&gt;) and was appalled — but not particularly shocked — at the amount of sites that are simply unusable with anything other than a standard browser. Most pages are so full of invalid markup that the screen-readers simply mumble on continuously and any actual content is undecipherable. If websites complied to the standards then their experience would be tolerable at the very least. Unfortunately the majority of website designers simply do not know (or often care) about creating accessible pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
Note: Screen-readers, for those that don’t know, take a web page and read it out using a synthesised voice. A perfectly accessible site would read the same as a printed document.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the largest problems with the way pages have been designed in the past has been using the supplied tags for their appearance rather than their actual purpose. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags have been used to create bold headings, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;font&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags used to change styles of fonts and worst of all the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags for layout. This means when a screen reader parses these pages it emphasises the wrong words and spouts nonsense when encountering these convoluted tags. What a properly designed page would have is a distinct separation of content and layout, of HTML and CSS. The HTML document should use be structured like a standard plain text print document; with appropriate headings, sub-headings, lists and paragraphs. These tags can then be styled using CSS to any manner to which they like. So when a screen reader encounters this page it reads the unstyled version; a perfectly formed document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the end of my little rant, maybe together we learned something.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ELMAH: Error Logging Modules &amp; Handlers</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/error-logging-modules-ampamp-handlers-elmah</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I talked about my exception logging system that I laid to rest. Fortunately for me that doesn’t mean my applications are logless, quite the contrary. I’ll explain…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came to terms with my logging system being inadequate and hard to maintain, I began looking for a replacement. To my delight I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raboof.com/Projects/Elmah/Elmah.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Error Logging Modules &amp;amp; Handlers&quot;&gt;ELMAH&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raboof.com&quot;&gt;Atif Aziz&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;acronym title=&quot;Error Logging Modules &amp;amp; Handlers&quot;&gt;ELMAH&lt;/acronym&gt; is basically a couple of HttpModules and a HttpHandler that intercept any unhandled exceptions from within your application and log them. This is where the fun begins…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download/create extensions that enable you to save your logs to wherever takes your fancy. There is a SQL Server writer, an XML file writer and I believe an MySql writer too. I’m currently using the XML writer simply because connecting to the SqlServer may be one of the possible exceptions raised. I’ve been running ELMAH now for 2 weeks and have had no issues at all; especially no write-permission related ones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/elmah.asp&quot; title=&quot;Using HTTP Modules and Handlers to Create Pluggable ASP.NET Components&quot;&gt;MSDN Article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/ScottMitchell.shtml&quot;&gt;Scott Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; was my manual for setting up ELMAH, not that it was hard. That article can explain it much better than I every could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got it all set up and assigned a location to the HttpHandler, you can navigate there and be presented with a log viewer. Details of the exception and even the actual yellow screen that occurred too (through a dump of the html) can be accessed though that screen. The thing that got me really interested was the ability to subscribe to an RSS feed of your log! Now I no longer have to spend 40 minutes on the phone trying to decipher what really happened when the client claims they “didn’t touch a thing, it just crashed on its own”. All you have to do is (in your favourite feed reader) enter your log viewer path with “/rss” added to the end (e.g. http://www.mysite.com/Logs/View.aspx/rss). Then you can get all the same details as navigating to the page, without actually having to do anything! Oh yes, life is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one thing I had to come to terms with while setting up ELMAH. That is the fact that only unhandled exceptions will be logged, so that meant most of my try-catch blocks were causing my exceptions not to be logged. The solution to this was to remove the blocks that weren’t performing any specific function except that of gobbling up the exception and firing out a generic error message. I felt uncomfortable with this at first, as I was letting exceptions run riot but then I realised there’s not much point in handling exceptions if I can’t actually do anything to correct the error that occurred. So letting them go unhandled is probably the best cause of action (what exactly can be done if your SqlConnection won’t connect? It’s not like you can just connect to your mirrored SQL Server). So those exceptions are bubbled up to the page and then ELMAH captures and logs them. Using the customErrors section of the web.config you can present your users with a generic error page to stop them from seeing the nasty yellow screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That my friends is the general gist of ELMAH…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exception Logging</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/exception-logging</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Something I’ve always been tinkering with for my ASP.Net applications has been exception logging. I often get irritated when users (or applications) supply me with misleading or incorrect error messages, or at least incorrect directions of how to recreate the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked for quite some time trying to create a Logging system that would cater for my needs, and I got quite close to doing that. I created a small go-between object for the Trace and Debug logging and wrote that to my own XML file. The idea behind it, of course, was to make it easier for my self in debugging problems, if I could supply my self with all the data that I know I would require to trace an issue then, in theory, I could correct it much more quickly. This took me quite some time to create and of course was not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few major (a.k.a. Huge) issues with my system, firstly the logger would only interact with your code wherever you explicitly told it to. Basically you had to write extra code wherever you wanted to log an exception. This was neither friendly nor desirable. The next issue was access rights for the XML files; this reared its head in a few shapes and forms. One of the instances didn’t occur very often but was a pain when it did; the writer was rejected write access due to another instance of itself actually writing to the file. I remedied this by making the writer wait until the other was done; this of course had performance implications though, having to stop everything within a page while the log writer sits idle. The other time it was an issue was whenever I wanted to archive the logs I had to wait until no other instances were accessing it, this also involved waiting but it takes longer to rename a file and create a new one than it does to simply amend a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of having to explicitly declare any usage of the writer was the deciding factor in me binning my writer. Sad as it is to see something that I spent a fair amount of time creating deleted, it’s always slightly reassuring when you’re moving onto a product that is fully tested and working and also includes all source code! More on that soon though…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A bit of culture</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/a-bit-of-culture</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is possibly something that everyone goes through at some point in their life, the desire to be more cultured. To me and most people this means going out and buying a lot of “classic” books and giving them a good going over. If you had tried to get me to do this a few years ago there would have been no chance of it happening, but it just so happens that I’m starting to get really into reading so this is a natural extension of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got my self the following books, anybody with any suggestions feel free to drop me a comment or e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heart Of Darkness (Joseph Conrad)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Animal Farm (George Orwell)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catch-22 (Joseph Heller)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gulliver’s Travels (Jonathan Swift)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fahrenheit 451 (Ray Bradbury)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For something a little different I also got The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud, a slight change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve nearly finished reading Heart of Darkness, not taken long really. Not surprising considering it’s only 100 pages long, I can’t say it’s had a huge impact on me. I may be missing the point completely but nothing really seems to have happened and I’m onto the 3rd chapter (of 3). None the less the point is that I’ve now read a piece of history and have an informed opinion of it rather than just hints of what it’s about from what I’ve picked up listening to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Personal Note: The new job</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/back-once-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since getting my new job I’ve been rather quiet on the blogging side of things, mostly do to the fact that I’m actually doing something with my time rather than just sitting around tinkering. Strange I know, but you get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’d probably expect, I’m not really supposed to talk about what I do for security reasons of course. It’s mostly working for the Swift group (caravans, motorhomes) doing their internal systems and web sites. Other things as well, but it’s mainly that. It’s all very interesting, a big change from serving customers in a supermarket thats for sure. It’s a really strange feeling actually going to work and learning something, I generally come home every night having picked something new up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started the job I’ve learnt that my coding abilities are much better than I thought they were, having being subjected to the woes that are legacy code. Definitely a nice feeling, it’s always rather hard to rate your abilities when you have nothing to compare them against. For better or for worse I’ve been developing in VB.Net, something I tried to stay away from when coding for my self but haven’t been able to avoid recently. Not my cup of tea really but it’s another addition to the CV. Speaking of legacy code, there’s been some serious Daily WTF material lying around. A prime example was this beauty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-vbnet&quot;&gt;Sub Function GetTime(ByVal hours, ByVal minutes)
  Dim hours
  Dim minutes
  Dim yHours

  yHours = hours * minutes

  GetTime = (yHours / minutes) + (hours * minutes)
End Sub
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really interesting! Note the lack of any variable type declarations as well! It hasn’t all been like this, but there certainly a lot of amusing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One resource I’ve found invaluable since starting to code professionally is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hanselman.com/&quot;&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/radiostories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html&quot;&gt;utilities list&lt;/a&gt;, there are so many handy little tools there that I can’t believe I’ve managed to live without! Some perfect examples are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/&quot;&gt;Lutz’s Reflector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/ruler/&quot;&gt;Jeff Key’s Screen Ruler&lt;/a&gt;. A tool for “reverse engineering” compiled .Net assemblies and a floatable screen ruler respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debugging Glory</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/debugging-glory</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Debugging is a great thing… Often though I’ve dreamt of some greater, more useful debugger. It would have helped if I’d actually gone out and looked for such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I haven’t found a better debugger. I’ve found how to use the current one better! I’ve enabled client-side script debugging, which is fantastic. No more using IE or Firefoxes vague error messages, I can now step through code just as you would VB/C#.Net. The big one for me though has to be the ability to debug Stored Procedures, yes SQL Server Stored Procedures. Breakpoints, step-through, the lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Client-side debugging is so obvious I was kicking my self when I got it working. All you need to do is go into Tools &amp;gt; Internet Options &amp;gt; Advanced and check the “Enable Client-Side Debugging” in Internet explorer. You may need to do some jiggery-pokery in VS but I can’t remember what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SqlServer is a bit more complicated, you need to copy the mssdi98.dll from your [visual studio installation]\sqlserver folder into your sqlserver instances binn folder. Then open up Enterprise Manager and grant Exec permissions to the user you use to log-in (or the Builtin\Administrators group) for the extended procedure sp_sdidebug. Lastly in your project options in VS mark the Enable Sql Debugging. That should be it, from the server explorer in VS you should now be able to choose “step-into” from any stored procedure, function or trigger!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity++&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goodbye Tesco</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/goodbye-tesco</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m outta there, finally free from the bounds of a supermarket job. I’ve been taken in by Evolution Interactive, a web/multimedia design company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now a ‘New Media Developer’, nicer than ‘Checkout Assistant’ if I do say so my self. It’s very strange to be in a real job, doing something that I actually want to do (and like doing). This is going to take some getting used to…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amplification, baby</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/amplification-baby</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving payment for my month of work, I promptly bought a new Amplifier for my musification; rendering me skint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats not the point though, the amp is hot! Line 6 Spider II 210, not the biggest they make but big enough for me. It weighs a bloody tonne! This thing comes laden with 12 pre-defined tones, 4 custom presets and all the knobs you know you couldn’t live without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12 default tones range from your standard spangly Clean tone right the way up to some godforsaken guttural death metal style distortion, with everything in between. Each one of these tones can be tweaked to your hearts content via the knobs, if you make a tone that you are particularly fond of you can store it in one of the 4 custom presets. These can be accessed via the 4 buttons on the head, or via the footpedal that comes with it. If you pay an extra £100 you can get a FBV Shortboard pedal that enables you to save up to 36 (I think) presets, nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in tuner, noise-gate, tap-tempo for effects… Pretty good for £300.&lt;br /&gt;
Now I can sound like Hendrix, even if I can’t play like him. (Hey, its better than not being able to sound like him OR play like him!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Caesar and Delphi</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/caesar-and-delphi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While bored yesterday I decided to have a go with programming in Delphi, something which I’ve been intending to do for quite some time now. Anyway, here is the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Download CaesarShift.zip 244kb&lt;/a&gt; (this download is no longer available, sorry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple cryptography program based on the shifting letters (Caesar Shift) methods. Took me about two hours, not bad to say I’ve never programmed in Delphi before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delphi seems nice, I’m not too keen on the syntax of the language though. Its all rather too much like VB for my likings, messy and unstructured. Maybe thats just me though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Host Problems... Again</title>
      <link>http://www.jagregory.com/writings/host-problems-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m back again (I know this post is a bit late), my ex-host returned my domain name to the registrar and I’ve had to re-jiggle things to get it pointed at the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all happened something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Web-host returns domain name.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I contact Nominet regarding re-tagging my now de-tagged domain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I fill out a form.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I fax the form with proof of ID.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I wait 5 days for them to do anything.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Upon re-tagging, I contact a new domain management company to take care of my domain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I wait a day for them to change my nameservers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end!&lt;/p&gt;
