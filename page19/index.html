            <p>Recently, while working on my website I’ve become exposed to the <a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behaviour JavaScript library</a>, which I may say is absolutely wonderful. Very simple and straight forward, completely removes the need for those cursed script tags appended to the bottom of a page; something which I’ve never liked doing but became a bit of a necessary burden! In short it allows you to execute arbitrary code on elements in the DOM using CSS selectors; so, for example, you can apply an <code class="highlighter-rouge">onclick</code> event only to elements which match <code class="highlighter-rouge">form fieldset div#items a.add</code><sup>1</sup>, very handy indeed!</p>

            <p>After being inspired by Kevin Cornell at <a href="http://www.bearskinrug.co.uk/">Bearskinrug</a> I finally decided to try a drawing tablet, one of those magical designer tools. I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DCL6G/026-0724979-2170829?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Trust 1200-V2 Wireless Scroll Tablet</a> from Amazon for a fairly reasonable £40, which was an absolute breeze to set up, windows picked it up without the need to install the drivers, which is always nice.</p>

<p>My main complaint with it is that I was unable to (logically) get the tablet to map to anything less than both of my monitors, which was rubbish because that meant the tablet was being stretched horizontally; so you couldn’t trace anything without it becoming distorted. I say logically, because last thing yesterday I somehow managed it, so my tablet maps to my primary monitor and my mouse continues to work across both - it’ll take me a bit of time to get used to swapping but it’s definitely worth it. I will try and figure out how I managed to get it working, so I can at least make a note of it for next time.</p>

<p>Now all I need to do is learn how to draw… I’m currently at <a href="http://neopoleon.com/">Rory</a>’s standard of drawing, which of course is amazing!</p>

            <p>Once again the guys at Mozilla have broken quite possibly the best plug-in for Firefox: the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/">Venkman Javascript Debugger</a>. This is becoming quite commonplace, with every update for firefox disabling the debugger until a fix is released.</p>

<p>Anyway, even though both the extensions manager and Venkmans official website both say there aren’t any updates available, Joe Walker from <a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/home">Getahead</a> has created and update that contains some bug fixes from Bugzilla, but most importantly Venkman now works with Firefox 1.5.0.1!</p>

            <p>The weekend just past was my first that I’ve had to work since I left Tesco. Not an entirely unpleasant experience, although I would have much rather had my weekend.</p>

<p>The reason we had to work the weekend was down to us launching (re-launching actually) a product for the Swift Group’s extranet, something that a lot of people had been rather worried about. Mainly because, apparently, the previous time this product was launched it corrupted important data for six months without anyone noticing. Wonderful.</p>
