            <p>This was a task and a half! As I mentioned earlier I somehow managed to get my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DCL6G/202-4350795-3732661">Trust Wireless Scroll Tablet</a> working on a dual monitor system, mapped to only the primary monitor; so here’s my little guide on how I managed it.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware there isn’t an option in the trust software to allow you to map to a specific monitor, only to restrict the area on the tablet (which isn’t at all helpful). So what I’ve figured out is purely a work around, and it isn’t great either<sup>1</sup>. This is mainly for my reference, but someone else might find it useful, so here we go:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open up Display Properties and disable (“un-attach”) your secondary monitor.</li>
	<li>Open the Trust Control Panel from the icon in your system tray.</li>
	<li>Re-enable your second monitor.</li>
	<li>Click ok in your Trust Control Panel.</li>
</ol>
<p>From there on out your tablet should only be mapped to the monitor that stayed enabled the whole time, that is until you re-open the Trust Control Panel. I didn’t say it was pretty!</p>

<p>What I can gather is that after disabling your monitor, when you open up the control panel it maps the overall screen size so it can apply that to the tablet, but when you click OK after re-enabling the monitor it doesn’t refresh with the screen change and so uses the single monitor values.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Also note that I have only tested this on my system.</p>

            <p>Recently, while working on my website I’ve become exposed to the <a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behaviour JavaScript library</a>, which I may say is absolutely wonderful. Very simple and straight forward, completely removes the need for those cursed script tags appended to the bottom of a page; something which I’ve never liked doing but became a bit of a necessary burden! In short it allows you to execute arbitrary code on elements in the DOM using CSS selectors; so, for example, you can apply an <code class="highlighter-rouge">onclick</code> event only to elements which match <code class="highlighter-rouge">form fieldset div#items a.add</code><sup>1</sup>, very handy indeed!</p>

<p>Outside of the web I got my hands on a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007A5FZS/qid=1141728007/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-0724979-2170829">Star Wars: Empire at War</a>, which is easily the best Star Wars RTS game I’ve played (which isn’t hard). Very entertaining, if a little same-y after a while. Definitely worth playing though.</p>

<p>Even further outside of the web — in the real world — Sara and I got tickets for the Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age and Motörhead show in Hyde Park, London. That should be an entertaining night and it’s a very good excuse to get ourselfs down to London again, a city we really enjoyed last time.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Any anchors with a class of “add”, within a div with an ID of “items” that itself is within a fieldset in a form tag.</p>

            <p>After being inspired by Kevin Cornell at <a href="http://www.bearskinrug.co.uk/">Bearskinrug</a> I finally decided to try a drawing tablet, one of those magical designer tools. I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DCL6G/026-0724979-2170829?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Trust 1200-V2 Wireless Scroll Tablet</a> from Amazon for a fairly reasonable £40, which was an absolute breeze to set up, windows picked it up without the need to install the drivers, which is always nice.</p>

<p>My main complaint with it is that I was unable to (logically) get the tablet to map to anything less than both of my monitors, which was rubbish because that meant the tablet was being stretched horizontally; so you couldn’t trace anything without it becoming distorted. I say logically, because last thing yesterday I somehow managed it, so my tablet maps to my primary monitor and my mouse continues to work across both - it’ll take me a bit of time to get used to swapping but it’s definitely worth it. I will try and figure out how I managed to get it working, so I can at least make a note of it for next time.</p>

<p>Now all I need to do is learn how to draw… I’m currently at <a href="http://neopoleon.com/">Rory</a>’s standard of drawing, which of course is amazing!</p>

            <p>Once again the guys at Mozilla have broken quite possibly the best plug-in for Firefox: the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/">Venkman Javascript Debugger</a>. This is becoming quite commonplace, with every update for firefox disabling the debugger until a fix is released.</p>

<p>Anyway, even though both the extensions manager and Venkmans official website both say there aren’t any updates available, Joe Walker from <a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/home">Getahead</a> has created and update that contains some bug fixes from Bugzilla, but most importantly Venkman now works with Firefox 1.5.0.1!</p>

            <p>The weekend just past was my first that I’ve had to work since I left Tesco. Not an entirely unpleasant experience, although I would have much rather had my weekend.</p>

<p>The reason we had to work the weekend was down to us launching (re-launching actually) a product for the Swift Group’s extranet, something that a lot of people had been rather worried about. Mainly because, apparently, the previous time this product was launched it corrupted important data for six months without anyone noticing. Wonderful.</p>

<p>Something I wasn’t too happy about when I first inherited this project is that it was my sole responsibility. Slowly I came around to the idea though, it would be all my fault if everything went wrong, true, but it’d also be all down to me if everything went well; looks pretty good being responsible for a whole project only 10 months into a job.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is now day 1 of the launch at an end and a few niggling things aside, everything went swimmingly. No show stopping bugs at all, only minor things that took barely more than a minute to fix. I can safely say I’m in the good books.</p>

<p>Here’s to day 2 going as well as day 1.</p>
