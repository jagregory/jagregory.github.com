            <p>I don’t want to make much ceremony around this, but I thought I’d mention it incase anybody else is interested.</p>

<p>As a part of a project I’m working on I needed a simple file to store some data in, and I didn’t want it to be XML (for no reason other than the verbosity). I could have used my own format, but instead I’ve gone for <a href="http://yaml.net">YAML</a>. If you’ve worked with Ruby on Rails at all, then you’ll be familiar with YAML. It’s a human readable (and writable) text format.</p>

<p>Of course, I still needed to be able to parse my YAML document. There was a project announced 2 years ago to create a .Net parser, but like many things, it seems very much abandoned. So, after my <a href="/writings/getting-started-with-ometa/">recent adventure with OMeta#</a>, I thought I’d hack on this too.</p>

<p>String parsing is hard. I don’t think anyone will deny that. You can parse it by hand, you can use regular expressions, you can walk it character by character. With <a href="/writings/sharpdiff-diff-parsing-in-net/">SharpDiff</a>, I needed to parse some serious text, it was in an expected format, but there are numerous rules surrounding it. I did not fancy parsing it by hand, or with regular expressions.</p>

<p>I considered writing a parser for it, but dismissed that after my dealings with <a href="http://www.antlr.org">ANTLR</a> in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio">BooLangStudio</a>. It’s not so much that ANTLR is bad, it’s just long winded; it’s completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor</a>tastic.</p>

<p>Anyway, after 10 minutes down the path of parsing it myself, I cracked and decided to look into alternatives to ANTLR. I came across <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ometasharp">OMeta#</a> and (with a reassuring nudge by Jeffery Olson) I went with it.</p>

            <p>I said previously in my <a href="/writings/brace-matching-and-your-language-service/">Brace Matching post</a> that I want to try to document some of my findings while working on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio">BooLangStudio</a>. Well this is my second post on the subject.</p>

<p>When you’re implementing a custom language in Visual Studio, there’s a very good chance that you’re going to want to handle indentation slightly differently to the defaults. Every language has it’s own rules, after all.</p>

            <p>Continuing on from my post about an <a href="/writings/alternative-to-abusing-using/">alternative syntax for the non-disposable using statements</a>, here’s a class I’ve been using lately. It serves as a wrapper around changing the colours in a console window. It’s not a difficult thing to do, it’s just a bit awkward because you have to maintain the original colour in a variable while you do your business.</p>
