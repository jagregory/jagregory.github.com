        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>I said previously in my <a href="/writings/brace-matching-and-your-language-service/">Brace Matching post</a> that I want to try to document some of my findings while working on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio">BooLangStudio</a>. Well this is my second post on the subject.</p>

<p>When you’re implementing a custom language in Visual Studio, there’s a very good chance that you’re going to want to handle indentation slightly differently to the defaults. Every language has it’s own rules, after all.</p>

<p>Most of the resources I found online we’re pretty poor for how to get this working. Most people we’re pointing to overriding <code>OnCommand</code> in your derived <code>Source</code> class, or implementing some interop interface (i.e. <code>IVsLanguageLineIndent</code>). I could get none of these working. <code>OnCommand</code> never got raised, and the interfaces we’re useless.</p>

<p>I tried a few different methods for handling indentation, but none of them worked very well. I tried capturing the enter key press, but that didn’t work. Then I tried capturing alterations to the document, but those also got fired for navigating the document, so you’d press the up key and add a new line!</p>

<p>It ended up being pretty simple to implement, once I finally found the correct way to do it. I’ll cover how I did this for BooLangStudio below.</p>

<p>In your <code>LanguageService</code>, there’s a method you can override called <code>CreateViewFilter</code> which sets everything in motion.</p>

<p>Create yourself a class that derives from <code>ViewFilter</code>, and then return an instance of it from the overridden <code>CreateViewFilter</code> method in your language service.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BooViewFilter</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">ViewFilter</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nf">BooViewFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CodeWindowManager</span> <span class="n">mgr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IVsTextView</span> <span class="n">view</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">base</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mgr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">view</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">override</span> <span class="n">ViewFilter</span> <span class="nf">CreateViewFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CodeWindowManager</span> <span class="n">mgr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IVsTextView</span> <span class="n">newView</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">BooViewFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mgr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">newView</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to make sure your project is configured to use Smart Indentation. If your project is complete enough to allow the user to customise this, then you’re fine. However, if not you can hard code this value yourself. In your language service there’s a <code>GetLanguagePreferences</code> method that returns all the preferences for your project. In that method you can set <code>languagePreferences.IndentStyle = IdentingStyle.Smart</code>, which is what I’ve done in BooLangStudio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll kick yourself for how easy this is. Now override the <code>HandleSmartIndent</code> method in your derived <code>ViewFilter</code>. That’s it really, in there you can access the <code>Source</code> object and do as you wish with smart indentation.</p>

<p>Taking BooLangStudio as an example, you can see in our <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/BooViewFilter.cs">BooViewFilter.cs</a> that I delegate the work to a <code>HandleSmartIndentAction</code>. This is to make testing easier by having as little dependencies on Visual Studio as possible.</p>

<p>The <code>Execute</code> method of our <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/HandleSmartIndentAction.cs">HandleSmartIndentAction.cs</a> class gets the caret location and passes it to an instance of a <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/LineIndenter.cs">LineIndenter</a> class, which determines (based on the previous line to the caret) whether the next line should be indented, or outdented.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="nf">Execute</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">view</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">GetCaretPos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">out</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">out</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="n">indenter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">SetIndentationForNextLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<pre><code class="language-boo">class MyClass:
  def MethodName(): # indent
    return # outdent
</code></pre>

<p>So that’s how to implement Smart Indentation in your Visual Studio Extensibility project, and a little bit of implementation details of BooLangStudio.</p>

            <h2 id="about-sharpdiff">About SharpDiff</h2>

<p>SharpDiff is a library for parsing the output of various diffing tools. It’s primary purpose is to reduce the time spent by SCM UI developers in handing diff output.</p>

<h2 id="why-sharpdiff">Why SharpDiff</h2>

<p>I’ve got a few tools in mind that require parsing of diff files. I figure it’s a pretty common thing for SCM UI developers to have to do, so I thought i’d put it out for others to use.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-your-first-diff">Parsing your first diff</h2>

<p>The implementation is not concrete yet, but the current (easiest) way to parse a diff file is as follows.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">diffContent</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ReadAllText</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"MyDiffFile.diff"</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="n">Diff</span> <span class="n">diff</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">Diff</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">CreateFrom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">diffContent</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>From there you have a compiled version of your diff document. Intellisense will be your friend here, but basically you have a Chunks collection, and a Files collection.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">article on Diffs</a> is worth a read if you’re interested. In short though, chunks are formed as a chunk header containing the affected lines, and the lines themselves.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh">@@ -1,3 +1,6 @@
</span><span class="err">This is a small text file
</span><span class="gi">+that I quite like,
</span> with a few lines of text
<span class="gd">-inside, nothing much.
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>The chunk header is <code class="highlighter-rouge">@@ -1,3 +1,6 @@</code>. The -1,3 describes the affected lines in the original file, the first number (ignoring the minus) is the start line, and the second number is the total of context lines plus subtraction lines. The second range (+1,6) is in the new file, and that starts on the first line, and has six affected lines; in this case it’s all the context lines plus all addition lines.</p>

<p>All the other lines are the actual changes themselves. A line prefixed with a + is an addition line, a line prefixed with a - is a subtraction line, and lines prefixed with a space are context lines. Context lines are used for aligning the changes in the document. They’re also useful for determining if the document has changed since the diff was created.</p>

<p>In the context of SharpDiff, your Chunks collection contains an instance of a Chunk for every part in the diff that resembles the above. Each chunk has the range info for the original and new file, and a Lines collection of each line.</p>

<h2 id="early-days">Early Days</h2>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> SharpDiff is still in early development. I wouldn’t recommend using it in production code yet, as the parser is severely limited, and there’s next to no error handling.</p>

<p>The biggest flaw is that it only supports the standard git-diff output, and doesn’t handle many special circumstances.</p>

<p>It does support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard git-diff header</li>
  <li>Index extended header</li>
  <li>Chunk header</li>
  <li>Chunk lines (added, removed, and contextual)</li>
  <li>No newline at end of file</li>
  <li>Multiple chunks per diff</li>
  <li>Multiple diff per input string</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn’t support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Other extended headers</li>
  <li>Formats other than git-diff</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>As quick example of what you could use this library for, here’s a screenshot of a git-diff application:</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Continuing on from my post about an <a href="/writings/alternative-to-abusing-using/">alternative syntax for the non-disposable using statements</a>, here’s a class I’ve been using lately. It serves as a wrapper around changing the colours in a console window. It’s not a difficult thing to do, it’s just a bit awkward because you have to maintain the original colour in a variable while you do your business.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Start..."</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">originalColour</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ForegroundColor</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ForegroundColour</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">ConsoleColor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Red</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"WARNING!"</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ForegroundColour</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">originalColour</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It’s not too bad when you’re only doing it once, but when you start swapping colours all over the place, then it can become very noisy. So this is where my class comes into play. Using the same syntax I described in my previous post, I’ve wrapped up the colour changing in a helper method that takes an Action delegate. This allows you to write much more intention revealing code.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ConsoleColours</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Foreground</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ConsoleColor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Yellow</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Different text"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I find this much cleaner and the blocks gives my console code some much needed separation.</p>

<p>Here’s the full class code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ConsoleColours</span>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/writings/alternative-to-abusing-using">Alternative to abusing using</a></h2>
        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>There’s been a bit of discussion of late about using statements, and how they’re more often being used for purposes other than just releasing resources. As always, there are those people who think it’s a flagrant abuse of a feature and shouldn’t be done, then there are those that like it. I’m in between. I do like what the using statement gives us, but I also think it is a bit of an abuse.</p>

<p>The “traditional” usage of the using statement can be found quite often in the land of files and streams. Take the following example, which opens a file and then closes it when it drops out of the using scope.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">stream</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">OpenRead</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"myFile.txt"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// do something with the file
</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Examples of the alternative usage can be found all over the place, but Rhino Mocks is one that’s close to my heart. Here’s from the record/replay syntax, anything in the scope of the using is recorded, and once it drops out of scope it’s no longer in record mode.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mocks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Record</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">Expect</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">customer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Address</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"123 Rester St"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Again, I do like what the using statement gives us outside of releasing resources (I’m not disputing it’s usefulness there). However, I think the using keyword itself adds noise and clouds intention.</p>

<p>With the adoption of 3.5, I’ve started using an alternative syntax instead of usings. Actions and anonymous methods to the rescue.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">Scope</span><span class="p">(()</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// do something within this scope
</span><span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It’s a little bit more noisy in the compiler satisfying department, but because you have full control over naming, you can reveal intention more. No more unclear “using”.</p>

<p>So how does it work? Simple really, the method takes an Action delegate, which it the executes almost immediately. I say almost, because you can execute code before and after the execution. That gives you the benefits of the using statements wrapping ability.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Scope</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Action</span> <span class="n">action</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// do something before
</span>  <span class="nf">action</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="c1">// do something after
</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Some more examples:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">OpenRead</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"myFile.txt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">file</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// do something with the file
</span><span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">mocks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Record</span><span class="p">(()</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">Expect</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">customer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Address</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"123 Rester St"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I prefer this syntax over the using statement. Of course, it’s only valid for 3.5 projects.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>We had an issue recently where NHibernate was performing very poorly on our production server, but not on our developer machines or our test server. I investigated the issue and narrowed it down to two symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Symptom 1:</strong> Very poor performance. I’m talking 10+ seconds per page load, with no more than 5 queries being executed by NHibernate.</p>

<p><strong>Symptom 2:</strong> Empty log files. None of our log files had any data in on the live server, but they did on our other systems.</p>

<p>I decided to investigate the second symptom first, as it may be causing the first (ends up it was).</p>

<p>Firstly, I noticed that our logging was set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code>. Must’ve been a leftover from when we first deployed NHibernate, very sloppy, I know. So I reset that to <code class="highlighter-rouge">WARN</code>, but it had no effect.</p>

<p>When files aren’t being written to, you should always check the directory permissions. Low and behold, it was a permissions problem. Our test server had different users allowed to write to the Logs directory than our production server. I granted the same users access, <code class="highlighter-rouge">NETWORK SERVICE</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">IUSR_MACHINENAME</code> in our case.</p>

<p>After I recycled the IIS worker processes, we were flying again. We’re back to having &lt; 1sec page loads.</p>

<p>This is pure speculation, but what I believe was happening is this: Logging was set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code>, so it was logging <em>a lot</em>. With each log call, the logger was failing to get write access to the files and throwing an exception, that exception would probably have propagated a bit too. The combination of the sheer amount of data being written to the log, and an exception per log call, were responsible for the severe slowdown.</p>

<p>So in short: Always make sure NHibernate has write access to its own log directory!</p>
