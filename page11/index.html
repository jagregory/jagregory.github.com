<p>String parsing is hard. I don’t think anyone will deny that. You can parse it by hand, you can use regular expressions, you can walk it character by character. With <a href="/writings/sharpdiff-diff-parsing-in-net/">SharpDiff</a>, I needed to parse some serious text, it was in an expected format, but there are numerous rules surrounding it. I did not fancy parsing it by hand, or with regular expressions.</p>

<p>I considered writing a parser for it, but dismissed that after my dealings with <a href="http://www.antlr.org">ANTLR</a> in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio">BooLangStudio</a>. It’s not so much that ANTLR is bad, it’s just long winded; it’s completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor</a>tastic.</p>

<p>Anyway, after 10 minutes down the path of parsing it myself, I cracked and decided to look into alternatives to ANTLR. I came across <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ometasharp">OMeta#</a> and (with a reassuring nudge by Jeffery Olson) I went with it.</p>

            <p>I said previously in my <a href="/writings/brace-matching-and-your-language-service/">Brace Matching post</a> that I want to try to document some of my findings while working on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio">BooLangStudio</a>. Well this is my second post on the subject.</p>

<p>When you’re implementing a custom language in Visual Studio, there’s a very good chance that you’re going to want to handle indentation slightly differently to the defaults. Every language has it’s own rules, after all.</p>

            <p>SharpDiff is a library for parsing the output of various diffing tools. It’s primary purpose is to reduce the time spent by SCM UI developers in handing diff output.</p>

            <p>Continuing on from my post about an <a href="/writings/alternative-to-abusing-using/">alternative syntax for the non-disposable using statements</a>, here’s a class I’ve been using lately. It serves as a wrapper around changing the colours in a console window. It’s not a difficult thing to do, it’s just a bit awkward because you have to maintain the original colour in a variable while you do your business.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>There’s been a bit of discussion of late about using statements, and how they’re more often being used for purposes other than just releasing resources. As always, there are those people who think it’s a flagrant abuse of a feature and shouldn’t be done, then there are those that like it. I’m in between. I do like what the using statement gives us, but I also think it is a bit of an abuse.</p>

<p>The “traditional” usage of the using statement can be found quite often in the land of files and streams. Take the following example, which opens a file and then closes it when it drops out of the using scope.</p>
