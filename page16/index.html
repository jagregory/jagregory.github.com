            <p>Test-driven development is a practice that has started to make some serious headway into the average developer world of .Net. The tools have reached a stage of maturity where they offer solutions to most (if not all) aspects of test-driven development. Alongside the improved tools there has been a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of articles addressing the needs of new and established test-driven developers. The combined effect of this is of a reduced learning curve for the average developer.</p>

            <p>When recently performing a system-wide clean-out, I removed a long-expired Macromedia Flash 8 Studio trial. Unknown to me at the time, it had taken it upon itself to remove the flash player as-well; because, of course, now that I don’t want to develop flash, I’ll never need it again!</p>

<p>Anyway, a week or so later I discovered that I needed to re-install the player, so off I went to <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe’s Website</a>. When I arrived, I was presented with a fairly reasonable page - in terms of design - but there was something on there that epitomises the lack of thought that goes into usability on the web. People, you have to remember it isn’t just about how you create your links (bad “click here”, no play-time for you!), it’s also about how your content is worded.</p>

<p>I was browsing one of my regular watering holes (water of knowledge, of course!) - <a href="http://www.theserverside.net">The Server Side.Net</a> - and I felt the overwhelming urge to make a reply in the forum. Registration was required, of course, so off to register I went. What followed was purely horrible on so many levels.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">demise of CSS hacks</a>, something which has been covered elsewhere to no end, definitely a good thing, but not what I’m covering here - not directly anyway. I’ve been wondering if we can take advantage of this new age of “hack segregation”.</p>

<p>The way I see it is we’re already breaking the rule of separation by using conditional comments in the structure, so why don’t we cease this opportunity to save our friends (users of Firefox, Safari, Opera etc…) some bandwidth by providing IE specific JavaScript in the same way too?</p>

            <p>I don’t know what it is, but there seems to be an inherent urge of web developers (or designers, managers or whomever) to create forms that are hugely bloated and pointless, even for simple things such as sending a contact e-mail.</p>

<p>This fascination with bloated forms is incomprehensible to me, I just can’t understand why anybody would want to know the gender or official title of somebody who’s simply trying to say “Hello”; it’s irrelevant, all I personally care about is what they’ve got to say. Is it supposed to portray the company in an intelligent, professional manner? (<em>These people want my title, they obviously mean business!</em>) I don’t know, but it needs to stop.</p>
