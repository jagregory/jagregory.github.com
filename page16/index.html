            <p>The DeleGrid is a control derived from the ASP.Net GridView, that delegates its data retrieval back out of the control. This allows the developer full control over the records that are retrieved, thus allowing proper paging to be implemented using whatever collection type you prefer.</p>

            <p>I started writing this as a comment, but I felt it’s own post was deserved.</p>

<p><a href="http://rickyclarkson.blogspot.com/">Ricky Clarkson</a> left me a link in a comment to one of <a href="http://rickyclarkson.blogspot.com/2007/05/you-dont-need-tdd-you-need-repl.html">his posts</a> that ties in quite nicely to my recent <a href="http://blog.jagregory.com/2007/07/17/getting-with-it-test-driven-development/">Getting with it: Test Driven Development</a> post.</p>

<p>Ricky makes the point that TDD can be dangerous, and can lull you into a false sense of security. <em>I agree.</em></p>

<p>As with any technology, when used incorrectly it can cause more damage than not using it at all.</p>

<p>Ricky’s example should serve as a double-barreled warning. You can’t be test-driven only when it’s convenient, and you need to have good test coverage.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Hobby projects, everybody has one or two on the go. They’re fun little side-steps from the mundane routine of developing for a living. These projects usually get a fair bit of thought put into them, but precious little time–an unfortunate side-effect of having a life outside work.</p>

<p>We’re all used to working within limited time-frames, but the limitations are much more noticeable when you only have a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. This time is precious, but unfortunately we often find ourselves spending the time doing much less than we would like. That might be because you’ve hit a design aspect you can’t solve yet, or more often because your time is spent flitting between tasks. This lack of visible progress has a demoralising effect, next time you get some free time you may be less inclined to spend it on your project because you know you’ll not make much headway.</p>

            <p>Test-driven development is a practice that has started to make some serious headway into the average developer world of .Net. The tools have reached a stage of maturity where they offer solutions to most (if not all) aspects of test-driven development. Alongside the improved tools there has been a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of articles addressing the needs of new and established test-driven developers. The combined effect of this is of a reduced learning curve for the average developer.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">demise of CSS hacks</a>, something which has been covered elsewhere to no end, definitely a good thing, but not what I’m covering here - not directly anyway. I’ve been wondering if we can take advantage of this new age of “hack segregation”.</p>

<p>The way I see it is we’re already breaking the rule of separation by using conditional comments in the structure, so why don’t we cease this opportunity to save our friends (users of Firefox, Safari, Opera etc…) some bandwidth by providing IE specific JavaScript in the same way too?</p>
