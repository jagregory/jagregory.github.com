            <p>When recently performing a system-wide clean-out, I removed a long-expired Macromedia Flash 8 Studio trial. Unknown to me at the time, it had taken it upon itself to remove the flash player as-well; because, of course, now that I don’t want to develop flash, I’ll never need it again!</p>

<p>Anyway, a week or so later I discovered that I needed to re-install the player, so off I went to <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe’s Website</a>. When I arrived, I was presented with a fairly reasonable page - in terms of design - but there was something on there that epitomises the lack of thought that goes into usability on the web. People, you have to remember it isn’t just about how you create your links (bad “click here”, no play-time for you!), it’s also about how your content is worded.</p>

<p>I was browsing one of my regular watering holes (water of knowledge, of course!) - <a href="http://www.theserverside.net">The Server Side.Net</a> - and I felt the overwhelming urge to make a reply in the forum. Registration was required, of course, so off to register I went. What followed was purely horrible on so many levels.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx">demise of CSS hacks</a>, something which has been covered elsewhere to no end, definitely a good thing, but not what I’m covering here - not directly anyway. I’ve been wondering if we can take advantage of this new age of “hack segregation”.</p>

<p>The way I see it is we’re already breaking the rule of separation by using conditional comments in the structure, so why don’t we cease this opportunity to save our friends (users of Firefox, Safari, Opera etc…) some bandwidth by providing IE specific JavaScript in the same way too?</p>

            <p>I don’t know what it is, but there seems to be an inherent urge of web developers (or designers, managers or whomever) to create forms that are hugely bloated and pointless, even for simple things such as sending a contact e-mail.</p>

<p>This fascination with bloated forms is incomprehensible to me, I just can’t understand why anybody would want to know the gender or official title of somebody who’s simply trying to say “Hello”; it’s irrelevant, all I personally care about is what they’ve got to say. Is it supposed to portray the company in an intelligent, professional manner? (<em>These people want my title, they obviously mean business!</em>) I don’t know, but it needs to stop.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>We’ve been sending out a (rather successful) e-mail campaign for <a href="http://www.swiftleisure.co.uk">Swift</a> over the past few days, a good experience and definitely an eye opener. Something that amused me over the course of the project was the way people were using the “Recommend a Friend” feature of the e-mail.</p>

<p>If you’re presented by a form, which asks for your friends name, e-mail address and some form of comment from yourself, what would you put in the name field? Common sense says that you should put their full name in, as generally that’s what people want; not these people though! Over 50% of the recommendations were supplied with first names only or nicknames - the most wonderful being “MUM”; yes, block capitals too.</p>

<p>So we have a nice collection of recommendations along the lines of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>George</li>
  <li>Sally</li>
  <li>Geoff</li>
  <li>
    <p>liz</p>
  </li>
  <li>MUM<br />
How very helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>They’ll love the targeted e-mails they’re bound to receive too; “Dear MUM, we think…”.</p>
