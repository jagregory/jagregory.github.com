            <p>I’ve just committed a breaking change to <a href="http://www.fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> (as of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/source/detail?r=184" title="Revision 184">r184</a>), which I thought I’d document here for anyone interested; it’s a reworking of the subclass syntax.</p>

<p>Mapping multiple subclasses with the same parent wasn’t a very fluent affair, and it was pretty <em>wordy</em> too. You can see a comparison of the old and new syntaxes below.</p>

            <p>We’ve all been in a job where “things are going to get better”, not just yet, but very soon. Perhaps you’re finally going to get a new product to work on, or that rewrite that’s well overdue, or a new development machine, or any number of other things.</p>

<p>Assuming you’re actually bothered by the non-arrival of your desired improvement, it’s very important that you set a cut-off date for it to occur by. Not only that, you also should define what action you’re going to take when that date arrives; typically, that’d be “leave”.</p>

<p>Subversion has started receiving some more flak in certain circles, it’s no longer in-vogue, no longer cool. Distributed version control is the big thing now, Git, Mecurial, Bazaar etc. Well I’m a huge Git fan, and I’m finding myself slowly transitioning away from Subversion project by project. However, I think I need to address something.</p>

<p>Subversion radically changed how people perceive source control, certainly in the environments that I’ve introduced it into (primarily SourceSafe based). That’s no small feat, and I don’t think it should be forgotten amid all the hype around newer source control systems.</p>

            <p>I don’t want to make much ceremony around this, but I thought I’d mention it incase anybody else is interested.</p>

<p>As a part of a project I’m working on I needed a simple file to store some data in, and I didn’t want it to be XML (for no reason other than the verbosity). I could have used my own format, but instead I’ve gone for <a href="http://yaml.net">YAML</a>. If you’ve worked with Ruby on Rails at all, then you’ll be familiar with YAML. It’s a human readable (and writable) text format.</p>

<p>Of course, I still needed to be able to parse my YAML document. There was a project announced 2 years ago to create a .Net parser, but like many things, it seems very much abandoned. So, after my <a href="/writings/getting-started-with-ometa/">recent adventure with OMeta#</a>, I thought I’d hack on this too.</p>

  <p><strong>Notice:</strong> I’m a novice at OMeta, and as such, you shouldn’t take my advice as best-practice. This is based on my exploratory findings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>String parsing is hard. I don’t think anyone will deny that. You can parse it by hand, you can use regular expressions, you can walk it character by character. With <a href="/writings/sharpdiff-diff-parsing-in-net/">SharpDiff</a>, I needed to parse some serious text, it was in an expected format, but there are numerous rules surrounding it. I did not fancy parsing it by hand, or with regular expressions.</p>

<p>I considered writing a parser for it, but dismissed that after my dealings with <a href="http://www.antlr.org">ANTLR</a> in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio">BooLangStudio</a>. It’s not so much that ANTLR is bad, it’s just long winded; it’s completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor</a>tastic.</p>

<p>Anyway, after 10 minutes down the path of parsing it myself, I cracked and decided to look into alternatives to ANTLR. I came across <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ometasharp">OMeta#</a> and (with a reassuring nudge by Jeffery Olson) I went with it.</p>
