            <p>We’ve all been in a job where “things are going to get better”, not just yet, but very soon. Perhaps you’re finally going to get a new product to work on, or that rewrite that’s well overdue, or a new development machine, or any number of other things.</p>

<p>Assuming you’re actually bothered by the non-arrival of your desired improvement, it’s very important that you set a cut-off date for it to occur by. Not only that, you also should define what action you’re going to take when that date arrives; typically, that’d be “leave”.</p>

<p>Without a cut-off you can meander on, days turning to weeks, weeks to months, and months to years. Before you know it years have passed without any actual changes having occurred, only the constant dangling carrot of hope.</p>

<p>I’m not advocating that everyone quit their job just because they don’t get to do everything they want. This is about when you’ve done everything in your power to improve things, to instigate change, and when that still has no effect.</p>

<p>You have to know when something has become a lost cause, and when it’s time to move on.</p>

            <blockquote>
  <p>Note: This is based on my personal experiences, and is not specifically “fact”. If your experiences differ, fine, but these are mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Subversion has started receiving some more flak in certain circles, it’s no longer in-vogue, no longer cool. Distributed version control is the big thing now, Git, Mecurial, Bazaar etc. Well I’m a huge Git fan, and I’m finding myself slowly transitioning away from Subversion project by project. However, I think I need to address something.</p>

<p>Subversion radically changed how people perceive source control, certainly in the environments that I’ve introduced it into (primarily SourceSafe based). That’s no small feat, and I don’t think it should be forgotten amid all the hype around newer source control systems.</p>

<p>The attitude towards source control prior to Subversion was that of fear; it was a black box that you threw your code into at the end of every day. Nobody really understood what it does, or why it does it, and even in some cases why they’re actually doing it. This was probably down to poor user interfaces, but nobody really <em>wanted</em> to use it, they just had to. It was never made a proper part of anyone’s workflow, apart from as a part of shutting down your machine at the end of the day (hopefully you remembered to do that!).</p>

<p>Then along came Subversion (sometimes with a bit of force), with it’s good tools, it’s stable repository, and it’s ease of management. You could host it through a webserver, everybody could access it via a URL. It never corrupts itself randomly, and it doesn’t require scary maintenance work.</p>

<p>With Subversion people stopped fearing source control, in fact they started enjoying it. People started deleting old code, entire swaths of code, because they were now happy that it was always going to be available. They actually made it a primary part of their workflow; multiple commits a day, regular history lookups, blame, branches, tags, the lot.</p>

<p>Maybe Subversion isn’t cool any more, but we shouldn’t forget what it did for many shops that adopted it.</p>

            <p>I don’t want to make much ceremony around this, but I thought I’d mention it incase anybody else is interested.</p>

<p>As a part of a project I’m working on I needed a simple file to store some data in, and I didn’t want it to be XML (for no reason other than the verbosity). I could have used my own format, but instead I’ve gone for <a href="http://yaml.net">YAML</a>. If you’ve worked with Ruby on Rails at all, then you’ll be familiar with YAML. It’s a human readable (and writable) text format.</p>

<p>Of course, I still needed to be able to parse my YAML document. There was a project announced 2 years ago to create a .Net parser, but like many things, it seems very much abandoned. So, after my <a href="/writings/getting-started-with-ometa/">recent adventure with OMeta#</a>, I thought I’d hack on this too.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-yayaml-yet-another-yaml-parser">Introducing YaYAML: Yet another YAML parser.</h2>

<p>Don’t get your hopes up, I’ve only implemented exactly what I needed out of the spec, which is very little indeed. However, it’s something I will carry on with when time permits. So what can you parse with YaYAML? Only documents containing a single flat sequence or mapping. <strong>No nesting, no multiple documents in a file, no variables.</strong></p>

<p>It’s possible to parse these two example files:<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">yaml
- a list
- of text
- strings
</code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">a</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">mapping</span>
<span class="s">of</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">various</span>
<span class="s">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">and</span>
<span class="s">value</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">pairs</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">James</span>
  <span class="s">age</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">23</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Peter</span>
  <span class="s">age</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">34</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That’s it!</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Notice:</strong> I’m a novice at OMeta, and as such, you shouldn’t take my advice as best-practice. This is based on my exploratory findings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>String parsing is hard. I don’t think anyone will deny that. You can parse it by hand, you can use regular expressions, you can walk it character by character. With <a href="/writings/sharpdiff-diff-parsing-in-net/">SharpDiff</a>, I needed to parse some serious text, it was in an expected format, but there are numerous rules surrounding it. I did not fancy parsing it by hand, or with regular expressions.</p>

<p>I considered writing a parser for it, but dismissed that after my dealings with <a href="http://www.antlr.org">ANTLR</a> in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio">BooLangStudio</a>. It’s not so much that ANTLR is bad, it’s just long winded; it’s completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor</a>tastic.</p>

<p>Anyway, after 10 minutes down the path of parsing it myself, I cracked and decided to look into alternatives to ANTLR. I came across <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ometasharp">OMeta#</a> and (with a reassuring nudge by Jeffery Olson) I went with it.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-ometa">So what is OMeta#?</h2>

<p>At it’s heart, <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~awarth/ometa/">OMeta</a> is just a really great string parser, and OMeta# is a .Net implementation of it. Combine that with a fairly decent definition language and codegen’d parser creation, and you’re onto a winner.</p>

<p>It allows you to write a syntax grammar and parse content with it, without having to worry about lexing, tokenizing and all that jazz. You only need to learn one language, OMeta.</p>

<p>While working on SharpDiff, I took a detour and implemented another very simple Git diff format. It’s a stat/metrics diff that just tells you which files have changed, and how many additions and removals have occurred in each. A pretty straight forward diff crying out to be used as an example.</p>

<h2 id="a-basic-ometa-based-parser">A basic OMeta-based parser</h2>

<p>Git has a diff format called stat (and it’s counter-part numstat, that we’ll be using). It produces output like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>1    0    myFile.txt
3    1    anotherFile.txt
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re following along at home, you’ll need to create yourself a new git repository. In there place a couple of text files, add some content to them and commit them. Then make some changes to those files, but don’t commit that. Now you can execute <code class="highlighter-rouge">git --numstat</code> to get the above output.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Git documentation is a wonderful thing, and it provides us with a nice outline of the numstat output.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>1    2    README
3    1    arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That is, from left to right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of added lines;</li>
  <li>a tab;</li>
  <li>the number of deleted lines;</li>
  <li>a tab;</li>
  <li>pathname (possibly with rename/copy information);</li>
  <li>a newline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we get to the meat, there’s a couple of things we need to do. Firstly, (at the time of writing) there are no binaries available for OMeta#, so you’ll have to download the source and compile yourself. Once you’ve done that, you need to reference the <code class="highlighter-rouge">OMetaSharp.dll</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">OMetaSharp.OMetaCS.dll</code>.</p>

<p>Due to OMeta codegening our parser, it really needs to be built separately to our main project. If we don’t do that, we could get ourselves in a mess when we write an invalid grammar and generate some uncompiling code from it.</p>

<p>I won’t go over how to do this, but basically wrap the following code in a separate console app, changing the paths to point to where your code actually lives.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">RebuildGitNumstatParser</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">contents</span><span class="p">,</span>
     <span class="n">p</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Grammar</span><span class="p">,</span>
     <span class="n">o</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">o</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">OptimizeGrammar</span><span class="p">,</span>
     <span class="n">t</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Trans</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="n">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteAllText</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">@"..\..\..\SharpDiff\Parsers\GitNumstatParser.cs"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That just gets OMeta to compile our grammar, then spit out a C# file.</p>

<p>One more thing, then we can get going. For this generation to work, we really need to give it a grammar and parser to begin with. So we’ll create an empty grammar and parser.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">using</span> <span class="nc">OMetaSharp</span><span class="p">;</span>
 
<span class="n">ometa</span> <span class="nc">GitNumstatParser</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nc">Parser</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GitNumstatParser</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Parser</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now we can begin! One of the wonderful things about OMeta# is that it can be test driven very easily, which really surprised me.</p>

<p>So lets create our first test!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">[Test]</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">ParsesNumber</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">Parse</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="s">"1"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Number</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="n">Assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">That</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">EqualTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In this test, we pass the Parse function a generic type parameter (int) which is our expected return type, then a string and an expression. The string is our input content, and the expression is the grammar rule to use for parsing.</p>

<p>I’m also using a shortcut method for parsing, which you can see below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">protected</span> <span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">Parse</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Func</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">GitNumstatParser</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Rule</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="p">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">ruleFetcher</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Grammars</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ParseWith</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ruleFetcher</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">As</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When you run this test, it should pass. We didn’t do anything, I hear you say. That’s because we didn’t have to in this case. OMeta# comes with a few predefined rules that you can sometimes take advantage of (or override to give different meaning in your grammar). In this case, we’ve used the Number rule, which parses a string and returns an integer from it.</p>

<p>Onto the next test.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">[Test]</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">ParsesAdditionsAndSubtractionValues</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="n">Assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">That</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Additions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">EqualTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">3</span><span class="p">));</span>
    <span class="n">Assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">That</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Subtractions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">EqualTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">8</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We need a class to represent our file statistics, I’ve created one called FileStats.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">FileStats</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nf">FileStats</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">additions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">subtractions</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Additions</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">additions</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">Subtractions</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">subtractions</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">Additions</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">Subtractions</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When you run this test, it will fail (and at the time of writing, fail with a nasty unhelpful OMeta exception). This is because we’re still trying to use the Number rule, so we need to create our FileStats rule.</p>

<p>Open up your ometacs file and follow along.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">using</span> <span class="nn">SharpDiff</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nn">FileStructure</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Numstat</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Right, that’s a bit of an overload, so lets go through it.</p>

<p>The line is made up from three parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rule name</li>
  <li>Pattern to match</li>
  <li>Code to produce</li>
</ul>

<p>For this line, we’re creating a rule called <code>FileStats</code>, which matches the <code>Number:adds '\t' Number:subs</code> pattern, and produces the code <code>new FileStats(adds.As<int>(), subs.As<int>())&lt;/code&gt;.</int></int></code></p>

<p>Lets examine what the pattern is doing. Firstly, we’re using the Number rule that we used in our first test. The colon denotes an assignment to a variable, so we’re getting the match from the Number rule and putting that in an <code>adds</code> variable. We then match a single tab character (‘\t’), and then another Number. Whitespace is ignored in the OMeta grammar, which means you can structure the file pretty much however you like.</p>

<p>Our pattern gives us two variables, adds and subs, we need to do something with them. The <code>-&gt;</code> operator designates the next curly brace surrounded region to be your desired C# code output. For this rule, we’re creating a new instance of our FileStats class, and passing our two variables into the constructor (converting them to ints at the same time).</p>

<p>At this point, run your side executable that recreates the generated parser. You should now be able to alter your test to use the FileStats rule instead of Number, and have it pass.</p>

<p>So what can we parse now? We’re able to get the additions and subtractions from a line such as <code>1    4    myFile.txt</code>.</p>

<p>We still need to be able to get the filename back though, so onto our next test.</p>

<p>This test won’t compile until we create our Filename rule, so off to the ometacs with us!</p>

<p>We’ve now got an extra rule at the end of the file, Filename. I can’t stress this enough, <strong>watch your commas</strong>; OMeta#s errors are poor, and something like that can trip you up.</p>

<p>Our new rule looks complex, but is pretty simple. It uses the built-in LetterOrDigit rule, which matches a single letter or digit. We suffix that call with a <code>+</code> which (like regex) matches one or more instances; that match is then stored in a <code>name</code> variable. Following that is a single full-stop. Finally, another LetterOrDigit+, which matches our extension. We then concatenate those strings in our C# output.</p>

<p>Again, recompile your parser. Now your test should pass. It simply matches any filename with an extension (room for improvement here!).</p>

<p>Now we can bring the two together, so we can parse a whole line. Next test!</p>

<p>Our grammar file is going to undergo a bit of refactoring too. We’re covered by tests, so why shouldn’t we? Our <code>FileStats</code> rule doesn’t really describe the whole line it should be matching. Really what we should have is a <code>LineStats</code> (that’s what our FileStats currently is) that just matches the numbers, then a FileStats that matches the numbers <strong>and</strong> the filename.</p>

<p>So what we’ve done here is redo our FileStats rule as LineStats, which instead of creating an instance of the FileStats class, just returns an array of it’s two matches <code>{ adds, subs }</code>; this encapsulates that particular bit of behavior. Next we’ve created our new FileStats rule, which calls our LineStats rule and captures the matches. It then matches a single tab, and the filename using our Filename rule, followed by a NewLine; these are then combined and pushed into the constructor for our FileStats class. We’ve defined NewLine at the end, and it simply matches the \r\n characters.</p>

<p>Rebuilding and running that test should now give success. We’re now able to completely parse a diff line. Only one thing left to do, parse multiple lines together.</p>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Our final test is a bit longer than the others, but it’s simple. We pass in some multiline input, and then assert that we have two FileStat objects, and that they’re correctly formed.</p>

<p>For this test we’re using another helper method, which returns a list of rule matches.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">protected</span> <span class="n">IList</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">ParseList</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Func</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">GitNumstatParser</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Rule</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="p">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">ruleFetcher</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Again, this test will fail because we haven’t defined the FullFile rule. So again to the ometacs file.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">FullFile</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nc">FileStats</span><span class="o">+:</span><span class="n">files</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">files</span> <span class="o">},</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>All we do this time is add this rule to the top, which uses the <code>+</code> operator to match multiple FileStats rules. They’re then returned as they are so we can convert them to an enumerable.</p>

<p>That’s it, recompile and run, you should now be parsing full diff outputs with ease!</p>

<p>As you can see OMeta# is pretty easy, and it’s very easy to test drive. There are a few quirks to doing it that way (such as having to create the compiled grammar before your test will run), but it’s a lot smoother than I expected. The grammars are quite simple too, and there are some shortcuts you can take which help make things easier. The SharpDiff grammar currently stands at just 49 lines, and it’s capable of parsing 90% of the standard git output, not bad!</p>

<p>I’ll just introduce you to another little bit of syntax that can make things simpler. Our Filename rule matches filenames with extensions, but it doesn’t match filenames without! That could be a problem; however, instead of creating a new rule for this, you can create multiple patterns for a rule. Each pattern will get evaluated if the one before it fails.</p>

<p>So we can update our Filename rule to the following, which tries to match a filename with an extension, and if it can’t do that, it then tries without an extension.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Filename</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nc">LetterOrDigit</span><span class="o">+:</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="sc">'.'</span> <span class="nc">LetterOrDigit</span><span class="o">+:</span><span class="n">ext</span>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>I said previously in my <a href="/writings/brace-matching-and-your-language-service/">Brace Matching post</a> that I want to try to document some of my findings while working on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BooLangStudio">BooLangStudio</a>. Well this is my second post on the subject.</p>

<p>When you’re implementing a custom language in Visual Studio, there’s a very good chance that you’re going to want to handle indentation slightly differently to the defaults. Every language has it’s own rules, after all.</p>

<p>Most of the resources I found online we’re pretty poor for how to get this working. Most people we’re pointing to overriding <code>OnCommand</code> in your derived <code>Source</code> class, or implementing some interop interface (i.e. <code>IVsLanguageLineIndent</code>). I could get none of these working. <code>OnCommand</code> never got raised, and the interfaces we’re useless.</p>

<p>I tried a few different methods for handling indentation, but none of them worked very well. I tried capturing the enter key press, but that didn’t work. Then I tried capturing alterations to the document, but those also got fired for navigating the document, so you’d press the up key and add a new line!</p>

<p>It ended up being pretty simple to implement, once I finally found the correct way to do it. I’ll cover how I did this for BooLangStudio below.</p>

<p>In your <code>LanguageService</code>, there’s a method you can override called <code>CreateViewFilter</code> which sets everything in motion.</p>

<p>Create yourself a class that derives from <code>ViewFilter</code>, and then return an instance of it from the overridden <code>CreateViewFilter</code> method in your language service.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to make sure your project is configured to use Smart Indentation. If your project is complete enough to allow the user to customise this, then you’re fine. However, if not you can hard code this value yourself. In your language service there’s a <code>GetLanguagePreferences</code> method that returns all the preferences for your project. In that method you can set <code>languagePreferences.IndentStyle = IdentingStyle.Smart</code>, which is what I’ve done in BooLangStudio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll kick yourself for how easy this is. Now override the <code>HandleSmartIndent</code> method in your derived <code>ViewFilter</code>. That’s it really, in there you can access the <code>Source</code> object and do as you wish with smart indentation.</p>

<p>Taking BooLangStudio as an example, you can see in our <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/BooViewFilter.cs">BooViewFilter.cs</a> that I delegate the work to a <code>HandleSmartIndentAction</code>. This is to make testing easier by having as little dependencies on Visual Studio as possible.</p>

<p>The <code>Execute</code> method of our <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/HandleSmartIndentAction.cs">HandleSmartIndentAction.cs</a> class gets the caret location and passes it to an instance of a <a href="http://github.com/jagregory/boolangstudio/tree/443929113ca77ae3c4613691f06f043f9d8f8d77/Source/BooLangService/LineIndenter.cs">LineIndenter</a> class, which determines (based on the previous line to the caret) whether the next line should be indented, or outdented.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="nf">Execute</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">view</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">GetCaretPos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">out</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">out</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="n">indenter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">SetIndentationForNextLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<pre><code class="language-boo">class MyClass:
  def MethodName(): # indent
    return # outdent
</code></pre>

<p>So that’s how to implement Smart Indentation in your Visual Studio Extensibility project, and a little bit of implementation details of BooLangStudio.</p>
