I’m back again (I know this post is a bit late), my ex-host returned my domain name to the registrar and I’ve had to re-jiggle things to get it pointed at the right place.

It all happened something like this:
<ol>
	<li>Web-host returns domain name.</li>
	<li>I contact Nominet regarding re-tagging my now de-tagged domain.</li>
	<li>I fill out a form.</li>
	<li>I fax the form with proof of ID.</li>
	<li>I wait 5 days for them to do anything.</li>
	<li>Upon re-tagging, I contact a new domain management company to take care of my domain.</li>
	<li>I wait a day for them to change my nameservers.</li>
</ol>
The end!
