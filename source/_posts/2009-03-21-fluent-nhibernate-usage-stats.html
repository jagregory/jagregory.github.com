Just been totting up some figures on how <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> is doing, thought I'd share them with anyone that's interested.

<blockquote>These are very rough figures, generated with no scientific consistency, some are cumulative and others are based just on the last full month. They're more just to satisfy my curiosity than to be rigorously accurate.</blockquote>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Downloads</td>
    <td>1,800 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unique visitors</td>
    <td>5,500 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Page views</td>
    <td>13,000 per month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mailing list messages</td>
    <td>450 per month</td>
  <tr>
    <td>Commits</td>
    <td>45 per month</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Something else that's interesting is of those 5,500 visitors/13,000 page views, 66% are coming directly from google, 4% directly, then the other 30% from referrers. Those referrers are broken down into (from highest to lowest): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="http://blog.jagregory.com">my blog</a>, <a href="http://pnpguidance.net">pnpguidance.net</a>, <a href="http://nhforge.org">nhforge</a>, then quite a few other sites forming the lower percentages. I'm surprised at how high Stack Overflow is, I guess it pays that I pay attention to questions asked about Fluent on there.

Those download numbers are probably not representative either as they're only of the zip files, while I believe the vast majority of people run off the trunk through Subversion, so it's hard to count them.
