<p>It's nearly here, at long last <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> has nearly reached 1.0. Now starts the official public testing of our 1.0RC.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0">release notes</a> on the wiki for more information on what's changed. There have been a lot of small breaking changes in the fluent interface, mostly reducing it's verbosity, and a few larger changes elsewhere. Don't expect to download this and have it <em>just work</em>, because it won't; hopefully it shouldn't be too painful though.</p>

<p>My plan is that this is a very quick turnaround for a release candidate. It's already undergone some heavy testing from some respected volunteers, but I wanted to get it into the public eye for a week or so before release. Ideally the RTM release won't differ from this one at all, but we'll see.</p>

<p>You can find the binaries on our <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads">downloads page</a>, and it's now included in the binary build releases too.</p>

<p>Any questions should be directed to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate">mailing-list</a>, and issues onto our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/issues/list">issue list</a>.</p>
