Just to let anyone know that hasn't heard by other means, I'm now blogging at <a href="http://lostechies.com">Los Techies</a>. I'm going to cross-post between these two blogs, so there's no need to update your feeds if you're too lazy; but if you're already subscribing to the Los Techies general feed then you'll now get me too.

You can find my blog at: <a href="http://jagregory.lostechies.com">jagregory.lostechies.com</a>
