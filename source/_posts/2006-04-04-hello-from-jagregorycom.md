You should now be receiving this syndicated content from my new(ish) website <a href="http://www.jagregory.com">http://www.jagregory.com</a>. I’ve finally moved away from the .Text powered blogging system I’ve been using for the past few years in favour of Typo, a Ruby on Rails system.

I have a few reasons for doing this but the main one is that my blog as well as my personal website both validate to <acronym title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> 1.0. On top of that, with the dynamic nature of Ruby on Rails, I can make changes to the layouts without having to recompile.

Please drop me a line if you spot anything out of place.
