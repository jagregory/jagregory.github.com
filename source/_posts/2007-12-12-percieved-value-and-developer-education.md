A <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/12/12/my-pick-for-altnetconf-quote-of-the-day.aspx#171928">comment</a> on a <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/12/12/my-pick-for-altnetconf-quote-of-the-day.aspx">post at Jeremy D. Miller's blog</a> caught my eye. To paraphrase, Jeff Tucker says that part of the problem of the lack of perceived value of ORM/TDD/IOC etc is down to the developers in question not having experienced the reason these tools exist.

He makes a fair point really, we use tools because they solve a problem for us, if we haven't actually experienced what they're solving then their value is appears to be much less than what it is. Similarly, the value of such tools and methodologies is nil when there is a lack of recognition of a problem even existing.

However, I don't think the solution is to have developers learn "the hard way". To discover the problem before using the solution is a problem in its-self. If we were to all learn from our own mistakes, and not from each-others, then we're not going to make much progress as we're all going to be solving the same problems.

Most people will have struggled with whatever problem has necessitated the creation of these tools/methodologies, so I think it's more a case of helping the developers connect the dots; "You remember such and such a problem? Well that's easily solved using methodology/technology x!", rather than making them retrace the steps of every developer before them.
