  <p>Note from future James: There’s nothing practically useful here for you now, this has been long-since
made irrelevant; however, it is an interesting insight into what things used to be like! Kids these
days etc…</p>

  <p>Having a debugger for JavaScript wasn’t part of the browser itself yet, Firebug was the first good
example of this and but only came out the year of this post, and Chrome wasn’t a thing for another
4 years. Instead you had to connect Visual Studio to Internet Explorer, and debug JavaScript that way.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Visual Studio could debug Stored Procedures. I remember this being particularly painful
and involving copy-and-pasting DLLs into various directories in your system. I’m glad we don’t
work with Stored Procedures much anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Debugging is a great thing… Often though I’ve dreamt of some greater, more useful debugger. It would have helped if I’d actually gone out and looked for such a thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, I haven’t found a better debugger. I’ve found how to use the current one better! I’ve enabled client-side script debugging, which is fantastic. No more using IE or Firefoxes vague error messages, I can now step through code just as you would VB/C#.Net. The big one for me though has to be the ability to debug Stored Procedures, yes SQL Server Stored Procedures. Breakpoints, step-through, the lot.</p>

<p>I’m outta there, finally free from the bounds of a supermarket job. I’ve been taken in by Evolution Interactive, a web/multimedia design company.</p>

<p>I’m now a ‘New Media Developer’, nicer than ‘Checkout Assistant’ if I do say so my self. It’s very strange to be in a real job, doing something that I actually want to do (and like doing). This is going to take some getting used to…</p>

  <p>Note from James 15 years later: I’m leaving this here because it’s cute and an early example of my
experimentation in multiple languages that would serve me well throughout my career. I find the
casualness of it amusing now. The download link is long since dead, and who’d want to run a Delphi
program that a 20 year old wrote?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While bored yesterday I decided to have a go with programming in Delphi, something which I’ve been intending to do for quite some time now. Anyway, here is the result.</p>

<p>Download CaesarShift.zip 244kb <em>(this download is no longer available, sorry)</em></p>

<p>It’s a simple cryptography program based on the shifting letters (Caesar Shift) methods. Took me about two hours, not bad to say I’ve never programmed in Delphi before.</p>

<p>Delphi seems nice, I’m not too keen on the syntax of the language though. Its all rather too much like VB for my likings, messy and unstructured. Maybe that’s just me though.</p>

on this domain). Don’t judge me on the banality of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m back again (I know this post is a bit late), my ex-host returned my domain name to the registrar and I’ve had to re-jiggle things to get it pointed at the right place.</p>

<p>It all happened something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Web-host returns domain name.</li>
  <li>I contact Nominet regarding re-tagging my now de-tagged domain.</li>
  <li>I fill out a form.</li>
  <li>I fax the form with proof of ID.</li>
  <li>I wait 5 days for them to do anything.</li>
  <li>Upon re-tagging, I contact a new domain management company to take care of my domain.</li>
  <li>I wait a day for them to change my nameservers.</li>
</ol>

<p>The end!</p>
