            <p>The current system I’m working with has a setup whereby the model (data access objects) are being used by the web-services for delivery; this means that the consumers of the web-services are directly tied to our inner implementation of our data access code. On-top of that, it’s old full of bad conventions, and is in need of refactoring.</p>

            <p>What do we want? <em>A Boo plug-in for Visual Studio</em>. When do we want it? <em>Sooner, rather than later</em>.</p>

<p>The initial aim of this plug-in is to provide a “good enough” experience when using Boo files within other projects. I’m not currently focussing on doing full-scale development with Boo; so the target is DSLs and Binsor. There won’t be any assemblies created, or anything else that would affect your project. The only difference between how you work now would be that you could write Boo using Visual Studio, with syntax highlighting and intellisense.</p>

<p>That’s for the initial version anyway.</p>

            <p>Making a Visual Studio 2008 plugin isn’t as hard as it sounds.</p>

<p>Making one that works is a bit more difficult.</p>

<p>Syntax highlighting is fairly straight forward, just run a tokenizer over the text and colour code each token appropriately. It’s the code sense that is causing me to go slightly mad. To determine what methods need to be listed when the intellisense pops up, you need to parse the code that’s in the document, then resolve any classes and references in there to build up a collection of methods to display. It gets more tricky when the document isn’t valid, because you can’t compile it. That’s where I am now, I need to figure out some way of partially compiling the document, or maybe using an AST walker.</p>

<p>I quite dislike mapping DTOs to entities, it’s a pain, but mostly tedious and tiresome rather than difficult. I decided to try to ease things by creating a library that would resolve entity instances to their DTO counterparts.</p>

<p>My requirements were few but I was determined not to violate any of them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Refactoring friendly. No strings for property names, changing names should give compiler errors.</li>
  <li>Must simplify code.</li>
  <li>Must improve maintainability.</li>

<p>What are dependencies? Also referred to as couplings, dependencies are other modules that one module requires to fulfil it’s purpose.</p>

<p>Are dependencies bad? No, of course they’re not, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to create anything. However, highly coupled code can cause a lot of problems for your application.</p>

<p>If your code requires knowledge of how a dependency works, then your code is highly coupled. If your code is tied explicitly to an implementation, then your code is also highly coupled.</p>
