            <p>I don’t know what it is, but there seems to be an inherent urge of web developers (or designers, managers or whomever) to create forms that are hugely bloated and pointless, even for simple things such as sending a contact e-mail.</p>

<p>This fascination with bloated forms is incomprehensible to me, I just can’t understand why anybody would want to know the gender or official title of somebody who’s simply trying to say “Hello”; it’s irrelevant, all I personally care about is what they’ve got to say. Is it supposed to portray the company in an intelligent, professional manner? (<em>These people want my title, they obviously mean business!</em>) I don’t know, but it needs to stop.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>We’ve been sending out a (rather successful) e-mail campaign for <a href="http://www.swiftleisure.co.uk">Swift</a> over the past few days, a good experience and definitely an eye opener. Something that amused me over the course of the project was the way people were using the “Recommend a Friend” feature of the e-mail.</p>

<p>If you’re presented by a form, which asks for your friends name, e-mail address and some form of comment from yourself, what would you put in the name field? Common sense says that you should put their full name in, as generally that’s what people want; not these people though! Over 50% of the recommendations were supplied with first names only or nicknames - the most wonderful being “MUM”; yes, block capitals too.</p>

<p>So we have a nice collection of recommendations along the lines of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>George</li>
  <li>Sally</li>
  <li>Geoff</li>
  <li>
    <p>liz</p>
  </li>
  <li>MUM<br />
How very helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>They’ll love the targeted e-mails they’re bound to receive too; “Dear MUM, we think…”.</p>

  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Added separate versions for SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005, due to the differences in the system objects tables.It may just be me, but when writing migration/create scripts for use with SQL Server I get quite agitated at having to write an ugly, long-winded, drop statement at the start of every object definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The support for dropping objects is one of the few things I would say MySQL has SQL Server over the barrel for.Baring in mind that if you try to drop an object that doesn’t exist, you’ll get an execution error; here’s how to drop a table in MySQL:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">DROP</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">IF</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span> <span class="n">customers</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here’s how to drop the same table, if you’re using SQL Server:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">IF</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">objects</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">OBJECT_ID</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">OBJECT_ID</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="s1">'customers'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="k">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="s1">'U'</span><span class="p">))</span>    <span class="k">DROP</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">customers</span>
</code></pre>

            <p>Just a quick tip to enable the Debug menu in Safari, the main reason being to get the JavaScript Console (ala Firefox).</p>

<p>Simply close down your open instances of Safari and enter this into the Terminal:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu 1
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That’ll enable a new Debug menu next time you start Safari, simple as that. I was on the verge of loading up Firefox on the Mac<br />
before I came across this, bad James!</p>

<p>Also, just in-case, running the above again with 0 will turn off the menu.</p>

            <p>The title pretty much covers it, but i’ll elaborate.</p>

<p>A few days ago I decided it was about time I had a tinker with <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps">Google Sitemaps</a>, part of which involves uploading a temporary file so google can be sure the website you’re trying to claim is actually yours. Anyway, fun things aside, google gave me an error message (“We’ve detected that your 404 (file not found) error page returns a status of 200 (OK) in the header.”) when it tried to read the file.</p>
