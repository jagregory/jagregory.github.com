            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/writings/preventing-debugger-property-evaluation-side-effects">Preventing debugger property evaluation for side-effect laden properties</a></h2>
        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Property getters with side-effects, now there’s a controversial subject if ever I saw one. Don’t do it is the rule; as with any rule though, there’s generally an exception that proves it. If you’re in this situation and you genuinely do have a scenario that requires a property getter to have side-effects, then there’s a side-effect (ha!) that you should be aware of.</p>

<p><strong>The debugger evaluates property getters when showing it’s locals and autos windows.</strong> While this feature is indispensable in most cases, it plays havoc with our property-with-side-effects. What the debugger does is call the getter to present it’s value in the autos window, at the same time firing our code that has a side-effect. From there you have pretty confusing behavior with code seemingly running itself.</p>

<p>My exception to the rule is mutator properties in a fluent interface. You can often find properties in fluent interfaces that when touched alter the behavior of the next method called.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="k">value</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Null</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span><span class="p">)</span>      <span class="c1">// returns true
</span><span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Not</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Null</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">// returns false
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>The Is class would contain a value tracking whether the next call would be inverted or not, and the Not property would flip that value when called.</p>

<p>Now assume this, you’re using <code>Is.Null(value)</code> and you set a breakpoint on it. Your autos window has expanded Is and shows the Not property, what’s just happened? The debugger has now called Not and altered your state! Undesirable.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerbrowsableattribute.aspx">DebuggerBrowsable attribute</a> to the rescue; this attribute when used with the DebuggerBrowsableState.Never parameter instructs Visual Studio to never inspect the property you apply it to. Your property won’t appear in the autos or locals window, and if you expand the tree of an instance containing the property it will show up with a Browsing Disabled message; you can then force it to evaluate the property, but at least it doesn’t do it automatically.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">private</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">inverted</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="na">[DebuggerBrowsable(DebuggerBrowsableState.Never)]</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Is</span> <span class="n">Not</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">get</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">inverted</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">!</span><span class="n">inverted</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Sticking the DebuggerBrowsable attribute on your Not property prevents the debugger from hitting it and inverting the switch.</p>

<p>So there you go, if your property-with-side-effects is being invoked by the debugger, you can use the DebuggerBrowsableAttribute to prevent it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, I’m not advocating properties with side-effects…&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

            <p>It's nearly here, at long last <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> has nearly reached 1.0. Now starts the official public testing of our 1.0RC.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0">release notes</a> on the wiki for more information on what's changed. There have been a lot of small breaking changes in the fluent interface, mostly reducing it's verbosity, and a few larger changes elsewhere. Don't expect to download this and have it <em>just work</em>, because it won't; hopefully it shouldn't be too painful though.</p>

<p>My plan is that this is a very quick turnaround for a release candidate. It's already undergone some heavy testing from some respected volunteers, but I wanted to get it into the public eye for a week or so before release. Ideally the RTM release won't differ from this one at all, but we'll see.</p>

<p>You can find the binaries on our <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads">downloads page</a>, and it's now included in the binary build releases too.</p>

<p>Any questions should be directed to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate">mailing-list</a>, and issues onto our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/issues/list">issue list</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a> has been gaining a lot of traction lately, and rightly so. I've used it for a couple of years now, for all my projects (<a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> and <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com">Docu</a> being the prominent ones), but something that hasn't changed is the tag-line of "but Windows support isn't very good!". What you quickly learn is that when people say that, they actually mean there isn't a Visual Studio plug-in or some similar all-singing all-dancing GUI; this is a dire misrepresentation of Git, because it's tooling on Windows is excellent if your definition of tooling includes the command-line.</p>

<p>It's something ingrained in Windows developers, they hate the command-line. There's a very good chance that if you encounter a Windows developer that does enjoy using the command-line it's because they've also worked on another platform or in another environment that encourages command-line use (Rails is a good example). I've tried various ways of encouraging people to experiment, but very few work without being able to sit down and just show them something. It's very much like R# adoption, nobody thinks it'll speed them up until they see how fast someone else can be.</p>

<p>Back onto Git. If you don't like what Git does, then that's fine, but don't label yourself as Alt.Net or a continuous improver if this sounds like you: "I define myself by choosing the best tool for each situation, but there's no way you'll get me using the command-line." Way to go, oh open-minded one. Try it, you might like it.</p>

<p>The other techies have been posting some great <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/tags/git/default.aspx">Git posts</a> which can help you get up to speed. I hope to contribute, with less bile, soon.</p>

  <p>Cross-posted to <a href="http://jagregory.lostechies.com/archive/2009/04/28/what-s-been-happening-in-fluent-nhibernate-land.aspx">Los Techies</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> has seen a flurry of development followed by a complete lack of commits, I figure it’s time to let everyone know what’s going on.</p>

  <p><strong>The Short Version</strong></p>

  <p>We’re rewriting the internals. We have 100% of tests passing, but still can’t guarantee no regressions. Stuff may break, if it does, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate">tell us</a>. It’ll be worth it.</p>

  <p><strong>The Long Version</strong></p>

  <p>Once upon a time…</p>

  <p>Fluent NHibernate at it’s core is a fluent interface over xml generation. We use the series of methods you call in your mappings to build up an in-memory hbm xml document that we then feed to NHibernate. Slowly, as we’ve started to support more and more of NHibernate’s features, we’ve started to find flaws in our architecture. It amounts to us not having enough separation of concerns; our fluent interface is generating xml, I think most people would say that’s not a good thing. Our xml is being generated too soon in the cycle to allow us to do more clever things that’d improve the user’s experience. That’s where the quiet time comes in.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.paulbatum.com">Paul Batum</a> undertook the task of redesigning the internals of Fluent NHibernate to be something much more scalable. I’ll leave the details out for now (maybe a future post), but it amounts to a intermediary layer being introduced between the fluent interface and the xml generation. We’ve dubbed this the Semantic Model, and it’s that which is now generated by the fluent interface, then later translated into xml. This added abstraction allows us to do things that weren’t possible while we were just generating straight xml.</p>

  <p>Whilst you wont see any immediate improvements while everything is being converted, the extra layer allows us to inspect the model before it is converted to xml; this gives us some immense capabilities, such as allowing subclasses to be separate from their parent mapping, create reusable component mappings, improve relationship support etc… We’re pretty much limited only by what we can imagine now, rather than by architectural decisions.</p>

  <p>However, we have a dilemma. The semantic-model branch has deviated so much from trunk we’ve got a major merge problem. A merge is pretty much out of the question actually, because there’s barely any commonality between the two streams at all. It was then assumed that the branch would eventually replace trunk (we’d just rename trunk to a tag, then rename the semantic-model branch to trunk), and all we needed to do was get the branch up-to-date with the features of trunk. Little did we realise we were essentially committing to something that I typically oppose, a complete rewrite! I’ve never been in a situation where that’s ever been a good idea, and yet here we are, responsible for our own destiny as it was, and we’d chosen a rewrite!</p>

  <p>A few weeks went by with very little work happening. I think we’d all started feeling demoralised by the idea of re-implementing most of the features from trunk using the new design. It was a worthwhile endeavor, definitely, but just very uninteresting. We repeatedly swore that we’d get this done, but all the while we felt less inclined to support trunk because every new feature meant a new feature to port too. We stopped.</p>

  <p>At that point <a href="http://www.bestguesstheory.com/">Hudson Akridge</a>, our newest contributor, had the balls to tell me that he thought what we were doing felt pretty futile. At that moment I gained a great deal of respect for him, as it’s something that was in the back of my mind for some time but I wasn’t ready to face yet. It was that which got me moving again.</p>

  <p>I sat down over a long weekend and took on the mammoth task of merging our rewrite branch and trunk, with the aim of allowing the existing code to exist alongside the new code; this approach, if it worked, would allow us to convert existing features at our own pace while still writing new features for the cleaner codebase. After a lot of unpleasant hacking of nice code, I managed to get all our existing tests passing while utilising the semantic model behind the scenes. Our old code still directly generates xml, which then gets injected into the semantic model via a nasty shortcut. It feels dirty, because I’ve had to comprimise some good code to get it working, but in a way I think that’s a good thing; if code is nasty, we’re all less likely to be content with it. The main goal was achieved though, and that was to allow us to work at our own pace on trunk.</p>

  <p>Where we stand now is three branches, trunk, integration, and semantic-model. Over the next day or so I am going to merge integration with trunk, which will mean the semantic model will be in use for new features. From there we can slowly migrate all the original code to use our new semantic model, all the while adding new features using it, then eventually remove the duct-tape that’s holding the legacy code to the new code and dump the old stuff.</p>

  <p>This is where I’ll give you a little warning: although we have 100% of tests passing, we don’t have 100% coverage. There may be some regressions that we aren’t aware of. If anyone finds anything broken that was working before, contact us immediately on the <a href="groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate">mailing list</a> or via the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/issues/list">issues list</a> and we’ll correct it. Regressions will be treated with the highest priority over any other work.</p>

  <p>That’s it, you now know more about what’s happening with Fluent NHibernate than you ever wanted to. I hope this sheds a little light onto what’s been happening with us, and perhaps why your patch hasn’t been applied as quickly as you would’ve liked.</p>
