            <p>Lets get some learning done. There are a few questions that keep cropping up when I introduce people to Git, so I thought I’d post some answers as a mini-series of blog posts. I’ll cover some fundamentals, while trying not to retread too much ground that the fantastic <a href="http://book.git-scm.com">Git community book</a> already covers so well. Instead I’m going to talk about things that should help you understand what you and Git are doing day-to-day.</p>

It's based firmly on the practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">convention-over-configuration</a>, and can be used in a mapping-per-class style using our <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Fluent_mapping">fluent interface</a>, or let our <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Auto_mapping">automapper</a> map your entities itself.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/writings/preventing-debugger-property-evaluation-side-effects">Preventing debugger property evaluation for side-effect laden properties</a></h2>
        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Property getters with side-effects, now there’s a controversial subject if ever I saw one. Don’t do it is the rule; as with any rule though, there’s generally an exception that proves it. If you’re in this situation and you genuinely do have a scenario that requires a property getter to have side-effects, then there’s a side-effect (ha!) that you should be aware of.</p>

<p><strong>The debugger evaluates property getters when showing it’s locals and autos windows.</strong> While this feature is indispensable in most cases, it plays havoc with our property-with-side-effects. What the debugger does is call the getter to present it’s value in the autos window, at the same time firing our code that has a side-effect. From there you have pretty confusing behavior with code seemingly running itself.</p>

<p>My exception to the rule is mutator properties in a fluent interface. You can often find properties in fluent interfaces that when touched alter the behavior of the next method called.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="k">value</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Null</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span><span class="p">)</span>      <span class="c1">// returns true
</span><span class="n">Is</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Not</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Null</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">// returns false
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>The Is class would contain a value tracking whether the next call would be inverted or not, and the Not property would flip that value when called.</p>

<p>Now assume this, you’re using <code>Is.Null(value)</code> and you set a breakpoint on it. Your autos window has expanded Is and shows the Not property, what’s just happened? The debugger has now called Not and altered your state! Undesirable.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerbrowsableattribute.aspx">DebuggerBrowsable attribute</a> to the rescue; this attribute when used with the DebuggerBrowsableState.Never parameter instructs Visual Studio to never inspect the property you apply it to. Your property won’t appear in the autos or locals window, and if you expand the tree of an instance containing the property it will show up with a Browsing Disabled message; you can then force it to evaluate the property, but at least it doesn’t do it automatically.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">private</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">inverted</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="na">[DebuggerBrowsable(DebuggerBrowsableState.Never)]</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Is</span> <span class="n">Not</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">get</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">inverted</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">!</span><span class="n">inverted</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Sticking the DebuggerBrowsable attribute on your Not property prevents the debugger from hitting it and inverting the switch.</p>

<p>So there you go, if your property-with-side-effects is being invoked by the debugger, you can use the DebuggerBrowsableAttribute to prevent it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, I’m not advocating properties with side-effects…&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>It's nearly here, at long last <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> has nearly reached 1.0. Now starts the official public testing of our 1.0RC.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.0">release notes</a> on the wiki for more information on what's changed. There have been a lot of small breaking changes in the fluent interface, mostly reducing it's verbosity, and a few larger changes elsewhere. Don't expect to download this and have it <em>just work</em>, because it won't; hopefully it shouldn't be too painful though.</p>

<p>My plan is that this is a very quick turnaround for a release candidate. It's already undergone some heavy testing from some respected volunteers, but I wanted to get it into the public eye for a week or so before release. Ideally the RTM release won't differ from this one at all, but we'll see.</p>

<p>You can find the binaries on our <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads">downloads page</a>, and it's now included in the binary build releases too.</p>

<p>Any questions should be directed to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate">mailing-list</a>, and issues onto our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/issues/list">issue list</a>.</p>

            <blockquote><p>Cross-posted to <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jagregory/archive/2009/07/20/git-s-and-command-line-fear.aspx">Los Techies</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://git-scm.org">Git</a> has been gaining a lot of traction lately, and rightly so. I've used it for a couple of years now, for all my projects (<a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org">Fluent NHibernate</a> and <a href="http://docu.jagregory.com">Docu</a> being the prominent ones), but something that hasn't changed is the tag-line of "but Windows support isn't very good!". What you quickly learn is that when people say that, they actually mean there isn't a Visual Studio plug-in or some similar all-singing all-dancing GUI; this is a dire misrepresentation of Git, because it's tooling on Windows is excellent if your definition of tooling includes the command-line.</p>

<p>It's something ingrained in Windows developers, they hate the command-line. There's a very good chance that if you encounter a Windows developer that does enjoy using the command-line it's because they've also worked on another platform or in another environment that encourages command-line use (Rails is a good example). I've tried various ways of encouraging people to experiment, but very few work without being able to sit down and just show them something. It's very much like R# adoption, nobody thinks it'll speed them up until they see how fast someone else can be.</p>

<p>Back onto Git. If you don't like what Git does, then that's fine, but don't label yourself as Alt.Net or a continuous improver if this sounds like you: "I define myself by choosing the best tool for each situation, but there's no way you'll get me using the command-line." Way to go, oh open-minded one. Try it, you might like it.</p>

<p>The other techies have been posting some great <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/tags/git/default.aspx">Git posts</a> which can help you get up to speed. I hope to contribute, with less bile, soon.</p>
